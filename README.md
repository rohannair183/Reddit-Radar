# Reddit Radar
**🚧 Work in Progress - Technology Trend Detection from Reddit Communities**

## Overview
Reddit Radar is an end-to-end analytics platform that detects emerging technology trends by analyzing discussions across tech-focused Reddit communities. The goal is to identify trending topics 3-6 months before they hit mainstream tech news, providing early intelligence on technology adoption, developer sentiment, and market shifts.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Trend Detection**: Implement TF-IDF analysis to identify emerging technologies from Reddit discussions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track how developer and tech community sentiment evolves over time
- **Cross-Community Intelligence**: Map how trends propagate from niche communities to mainstream tech discussions
- **Predictive Analytics**: Identify "trend leader" vs "trend follower" communities
