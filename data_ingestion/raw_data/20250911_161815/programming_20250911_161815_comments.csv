>Why is this? As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

Way to finally come around and see the value of open source üôÑ the hobbyists finally won I guess. 

And it's a little ironic to finally open source it, because the Altair BASIC debacle was almost like the invention of non-open source software. Back then, there weren't words for ""free (as in speech) software"" nor ""open source"" because it was just presumed that once any software's in your hands you can examine it, modify it, or share it, which is all open source means.

I also sort of appreciate Eclipse as an engineering endeavour. A full-blown IDE is a complex piece of software, and the plugin system makes it even more so. It's really not trivial to get even nearly right.

But in practice, it's nowadays hard to see why IDEA wouldn't be a better option. The community edition works for simpler purposes, and for companies the licensing costs for ultimate really shouldn't be too bitter a pill to swallow. Sure its list price e.g. in Europe is ~600 euros per year, but even without volume discounts that's still less than 1% of the cost of a software developer, even outside of the top-paying countries. Considering how central the IDE is as a tool for most developers, it doesn't make much sense to skimp on it just to save a few pennies. If you gain 1% of productivity (including through developer morale), it already more than pays for itself.

A company may choose to avoid that cost and use Eclipse instead, but that'd immediately make me quite sceptical of that company's priorities.

The larger the data set, the greater the gains of radix sort, in comparison to damn near every other sorting algorithm. Its biggest problem is that it can only work on numbers. Introduce the hashing function.

But then your sort is only as granular as your hashing function which is its own deep dive of optimizations. Additionally, the radix sort relies on sifting the keys into buckets. I just watched a video on this topic, but I'm tired as shit right now so the information isn't coming back to me.

If one uses an array of records holding the 64-bit values to be sorted and the indices in the original array, the process of fetching data from strings into that array may not be particularly cache-friendly, but each chunk of string data would only need to be processed once, rather than lgN times.",3,1757611335.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ne6jtd/hashed_sorting_is_typically_faster_than_hash/ndo2mda/,False,1,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:17:33.950523+00:00,programming
ndo8gm1,1ne6jtd,ndo2mda,Solonotix,"Perhaps what you intend is to convert the strings back to arrays of bytes and then concatenate 8 bytes into 64-bit integers, which should be a trivial conversion in most low-level languages. However, the problem again becomes pre-allocating memory.

Now, instead of having the 4‚Åµ buckets (each byte split into 2-bit values for sorting) it would be 4^(5N) where N is the number of 64-bit chunks of the longest string you accept. When dealing with Unicode data, and emojis, that footprint grows rapidly (most Unicode characters are 2-byte segments, but some emoji can be 4 Unicode characters, representing a 64-bit value unto themselves).

And so we get back to why there are options. Some sorting algorithms have great performance under very specific conditions. For instance, insertion sort has an optimal time cost of `O(n)`, but an average case of n¬≤. Radix sort is blazingly fast and also scales `O(n)`, but only works on numbers. In general, you'll see quicksort used because it is predictably fast at `O(n log n)`, doesn't require excess memory allocations up front, and it is fairly well known or easy enough to implement.

With dynamic PGO, the JIT is able to instrument a method‚Äôs compilation and then use the resulting profiling data as part of emitting an optimized version of the method. One of the things it can profile are which types are used in a virtual dispatch. If one type dominates, it can special-case that type in the code gen and emit a customized implementation specific to that type. That then enables devirtualization in that dedicated path, which is ‚Äúguarded‚Äù by the relevant type check, hence ‚ÄúGDV‚Äù. In some cases, however, such as if a virtual call was being made in a shared generic context, GDV would not kick in. Now it will.

ndhahrv,1ndemk4,1ndemk4,grauenwolf,"> Eliminating some covariance checks. Writing into arrays of reference types can require ‚Äúcovariance checks.‚Äù Imagine you have a class Base and two derived types Derived1 : Base and Derived2 : Base. Since arrays in .NET are covariant, I can have a Derived1[] and cast it successfully to a Base[], but under the covers that‚Äôs still a Derived1[]. That means, for example, that any attempt to store a Derived2 into that array should fail at runtime, even if it compiles. 

Array covariance was a mistake in Java that .NET copied. 

In some ways it makes sense because .NET was originally meant to run Java code via the J# language. But J# never had a chance because it was based on an outdated version of Java that virtually everyone moved away from before .NET was released.

This is where J++ enters the story. When Sun sued Microsoft over making Java better so it could work with COM (specifically by adding properties and events), part of the agreement was that J++ would be frozen at Java 1.1. Which was a real problem because Java 1.2 brought a lot of enhancements that everyone agreed were necessary. 

Going back to J#, I don't know if it was literally based on J++ or just influenced by it. But either way, it too was limited to Java 1.1 features. Which meant it really had no chance and thus the array covariance wasn't really needed.",3,1757524307.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ndemk4/performance_improvements_in_net_10/ndhahrv/,False,0,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:17:41.989677+00:00,programming
ndhbcep,1ndemk4,1ndemk4,grauenwolf,"> More strength reduction. ‚ÄúStrength reduction‚Äù is a classic compiler optimization that replaces more expensive operations, like multiplications, with cheaper ones, like additions. In .NET 9, this was used to transform indexed loops that used multiplied offsets (e.g. index * elementSize) into loops that simply incremented a pointer-like offset (e.g. offset += elementSize), cutting down on arithmetic overhead and improving performance. 

This is where the ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" comes into play. The author of that saying wasn't talking about all optimizations. Rather, he was talking specifically about small optimizations like manually converting multiplication into addition. 

To put it into plain English, it's better to write code that shows the intent of the programmer and let the compiler handle the optimization tricks. It can do it more reliably than you can and, if a better trick is found, switch to that at no cost to you.

I'd suggest that the responsibility of the developer towards performance during initial build out goes a bit farther than that.

Anyways, here's the copy-pasta I often provide when this quote is mentioned:

https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451

> Every programmer with a few years' experience or education has heard the phrase ""premature optimization is the root of all evil."" This famous quote by Sir Tony Hoare (popularized by Donald Knuth) has become a best practice among software engineers. Unfortunately, as with many ideas that grow to legendary status, the original meaning of this statement has been all but lost and today's software engineers apply this saying differently from its original intent.

> ""Premature optimization is the root of all evil"" has long been the rallying cry by software engineers to avoid any thought of application performance until the very end of the software development cycle (at which point the optimization phase is typically ignored for economic/time-to-market reasons). However, **Hoare was not saying, ""concern about application performance during the early stages of an application's development is evil.""** He specifically said premature optimization; and optimization meant something considerably different back in the days when he made that statement. Back then, ""optimization"" often consisted of activities such as counting cycles and instructions in assembly language code. This is not the type of coding you want to do during initial program design, when the code base is rather fluid.

> Indeed, a short essay by Charles Cook (http://www.cookcomputing.com/blog/archives/000084.html), part of which I've reproduced below, describes the problem with reading too much into Hoare's statement:

> I've always thought this quote has all too often led software designers into serious mistakes because it has been applied to a different problem domain to what was intended. The full version of the quote is ""We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."" and I agree with this. Its usually not worth spending a lot of time micro-optimizing code before its obvious where the performance bottlenecks are. But, conversely, **when designing software at a system level, performance issues should always be considered from the beginning**. A good software developer will do this automatically, having developed a feel for where performance issues will cause problems. **An inexperienced developer will not bother, misguidedly believing that a bit of fine tuning at a later stage will fix any problems.**",15,1757528222.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ndemk4/performance_improvements_in_net_10/ndhon07/,False,1,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:17:41.989908+00:00,programming

The point is that many practical problems can be solved using constraint solvers and only when they become a bottleneck, it makes sense to invest time into developing a bespoke algorithm. Also, saying they are ‚Äòbrute-force‚Äô is technically true, but ignores decades of intense research in the field and the tons of ingenious heuristics which make these solvers usable in practice, since a naive brute-force algorithm would fail to finish in reasonable time for all but tiny toy examples.",10,1757600278.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ndjw6y/many_hard_leetcode_problems_are_easy_constraint/ndn0rh9/,False,3,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:17:49.076553+00:00,programming
