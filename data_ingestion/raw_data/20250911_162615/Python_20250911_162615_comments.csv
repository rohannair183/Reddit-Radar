ndk0r8c,1ndj5vz,ndjieie,EricHermosis,"Hi!, no, it simply does what it does, but you can get object cache with lru cache from functools, here is an example:



    from functools import lru_cache
    from pydepends import inject, Depends, Provider
    
    provider = Provider()
    
    class ExpensiveObject:
        counter = 0
        def __init__(self):
            ExpensiveObject.counter += 1
            print(f""ExpensiveObject created #{ExpensiveObject.counter}"")

        main()
        main()
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":

`ExpensiveObject created #1`

`Got object <__main__.ExpensiveObject object at 0x7ca47133c5f0>`

`Got object <__main__.ExpensiveObject object at 0x7ca47133c5f0>`

Anyways, if my digging through the [Tcl/Tk code](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/timeline?y=ci) is correct, here's how colour names are looked up:

On Unix (including Linux), Tk uses [XParseColor](https://linux.die.net/man/3/xparsecolor) from the libX11 library is used. How that translates a name depends on the X server, but everything pretty much looks in `rgb.txt`, which on my box is at `/etc/X11/rgb.txt` or `/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt`.  By default, this should be colours listed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names), but you could probably add your own colours there.

On macOS, with the native UI (""Aqua""), and on Windows, Tk uses [its own version of XParseColor](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/file?name=xlib/xcolors.c&ci=tip) with its own internal colour name table.

For macOS and Windows Tk also supports ""system"" colours.  These names start with 'system' and are specific to each platform.  The Windows colours are in [win/tkWinColor.c](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/file?ci=tip&name=win%2FtkWinColor.c&ln=38), and the macOS colours are in [macosx/tkMacOSXColor.h](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/file?name=macosx/tkMacOSXColor.h&ci=tip). (I've linked to the current versions of those files; since most Python installations would be linking against 8.6 and not the recently-released 9.0, colour names may be different.)",4,1757568490.0,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndnusy/a_complete_list_of_python_tkinter_colors_valid/ndl3uh8/,False,2,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:25:38.356982+00:00,Python
