1nefcw8,"We forked styled-components because it never implemented React 18's performance APIs. 40% faster for Linear, zero code changes needed.","## TL;DR
styled-components entered maintenance mode. We forked it with React 18/19 optimizations. 

Linear got 40% faster initial renders. Drop-in replacement, no code changes needed.

GitHub: https://github.com/sanity-io/styled-components-last-resort

## The Context

styled-components maintainer announced maintenance mode earlier this year and recommended not using it for new projects. Respect - maintaining 34k stars for free is brutal.

But millions of components exist in production. They can't just disappear.

## What We Did

We had PR #4332 sitting since July 2024 with React 18 optimizations. With maintenance mode, we turned it into a community fork. Key fixes:

- React 18's useInsertionEffect
- React 19 streaming SSR support  
- Modern JS output instead of ES5
- Native array operations

## Results

Linear tested it: 40% faster initial renders, zero code changes.

## How to Use
```npm install u/sanity/styled-components@npm:styled-components```

Or for React 19:
```npm install u/sanity/css-in-js@npm:styled-components```

## Important

We're not the new maintainers. We're literally migrating away ourselves. This is explicitly temporary - a performance bridge while you migrate.

1ne8xuj,AI-Rulez v2: One Config to Rule All Your TypeScript AI Tools,"## The Problem

If you're using multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode), you've probably noticed the configuration fragmentation. Each tool demands its own format - `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone.

## The Solution

AI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. It's like having a build system for AI context.

## Why This Matters for TypeScript Teams

Development teams face common challenges:

- **Multiple tools, multiple configs**: Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions
- **TypeScript-specific standards**: Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management
- **Monorepo complexity**: Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts  
- **Team consistency**: Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors

AI-Rulez solves this with a single `ai-rulez.yaml` that understands your project's conventions.

## AI-Powered Multi-Agent Configuration Generation

The `init` command is where AI-Rulez shines. Instead of manually writing configurations, **multiple specialized AI agents analyze your codebase** and collaborate to generate comprehensive instructions:

```bash
# Multiple AI agents analyze your codebase and generate rich config
npx ai-rulez init ""My TypeScript Project"" --preset popular --use-agent claude --yes
```

This automatically:

- **Codebase Analysis Agent**: Detects your tech stack (React/Vue/Angular, testing frameworks, build tools)
- **Patterns Agent**: Identifies project conventions and architectural patterns
- **Standards Agent**: Generates appropriate coding standards and best practices
- **Specialization Agent**: Creates domain-specific agents for different tasks (code review, testing, documentation)
- **Security Agent**: Automatically adds all generated AI files to `.gitignore`

The result is extensive, rich AI assistant instructions tailored specifically to your TypeScript project.

## Universal Output Generation

One YAML config generates files for every tool:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
metadata:
  name: ""TypeScript API Service""

presets:
  - ""popular""  # Auto-configures Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini

rules:
  - name: ""TypeScript Standards""
    priority: critical
    content: |
      - Strict TypeScript 5.0+ with noImplicitAny
      - Use const assertions and readonly types
      - Prefer type over interface for unions
      - ESLint with @typescript-eslint/strict rules

  - name: ""Testing Requirements""
    priority: high
    content: |
      - Vitest for unit tests with TypeScript support
      - Playwright for E2E testing
      - 90%+ coverage for new code
      - Mock external dependencies properly

agents:
  - name: ""typescript-expert""
    description: ""TypeScript specialist for type safety and performance""
    system_prompt: ""Focus on advanced TypeScript patterns, performance optimization, and maintainable code architecture""
```

Run `npx ai-rulez generate` and get:

- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` for Cursor  
- `.windsurfrules` for Windsurf
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot
- `AGENTS.md` for OpenCode
- Custom formats for any future AI tool

## Advanced Features

**MCP Server Integration**: Direct integration with AI tools:

```bash
# Start built-in MCP server with 19 configuration management tools
npx ai-rulez mcp
```

**CLI Management**: Update configs without editing YAML:

```bash
# Add React-specific rules
npx ai-rulez add rule ""React Standards"" --priority high --content ""Use functional components with hooks, prefer composition over inheritance""

# Create specialized agents  
npx ai-rulez add agent ""react-expert"" --description ""React specialist for component architecture and state management""
```

**Team Collaboration**:
- Remote config includes: `includes: [""https://github.com/myorg/typescript-standards.yaml""]`
- Local overrides via `.local.yaml` files
- Monorepo support with `--recursive` flag

## Real-World TypeScript Example

Here's how a Next.js + tRPC project benefits:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
extends: ""https://github.com/myorg/typescript-base.yaml""

sections:
  - name: ""Stack""
    content: |
      - Next.js 14 with App Router
      - tRPC for type-safe APIs
      - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
      - TailwindCSS for styling

agents:
  - name: ""nextjs-expert""
    system_prompt: ""Next.js specialist focusing on App Router, SSR/SSG optimization, and performance""
  
  - name: ""api-reviewer""
    system_prompt: ""tRPC/API expert for type-safe backend development and database optimization""
```

This generates tailored configurations ensuring consistent guidance whether you're working on React components or tRPC procedures.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g ai-rulez

# Or run without installing
npx ai-rulez init ""My TypeScript Project"" --preset popular --yes

# Generate configuration files
ai-rulez generate

# Add to package.json scripts
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""ai:generate"": ""ai-rulez generate"",
    ""ai:validate"": ""ai-rulez validate""
  }
}
```

## Why AI-Rulez vs Alternatives

**vs Manual Management**: No more maintaining separate config files that drift apart

**vs Basic Tools**: AI-powered multi-agent analysis generates rich, contextual instructions rather than simple templates

**vs Tool-Specific Solutions**: Future-proof approach works with new AI tools automatically

## Enterprise Features

- **Security**: SSRF protection, schema validation, audit trails
- **Performance**: Go-based with instant startup for large TypeScript monorepos  
- **Team Management**: Centralized configuration with local overrides
- **CI/CD Integration**: Pre-commit hooks and automated validation

AI-Rulez has evolved significantly since v1.0, adding multi-agent AI-powered initialization, comprehensive MCP integration, and enterprise-grade features. Teams managing large TypeScript codebases use it to ensure consistent AI assistant behavior across their entire development workflow.

The multi-agent `init` command is particularly powerful - instead of generic templates, you get rich, project-specific AI instructions generated by specialized agents analyzing your actual codebase.
