It kind of really upsets me that we have videos of Charlie kirk being shot in the neck spread across social media for anyone to see but there are never any clear videos of these innocent kids gets killed in mass shootings. If we had clear videos of kids bleeding out in their elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms, then maybe people will finally wake up and want to do something about gun violence and these horrific mass shootings. 

I was hoping while Biden was president that he would have a press conference where they lay out all the crime scene photos of columbine, Sandy hook, Parkland, Las Vegas, etc. Maybe if republicans and others who are silent on the matter are confronted with the horrors and gore then maybe they will finally start to care. 

I know that the fact that Vietnam was the first televised and well documented war really helped to galvanize American support for ending the war since people were bombarded with images and videos of dead civilians and soldiers on a daily basis and people who normally would have never seen the battlefield got to see the destruction, death, trauma, and gore that the Vietnam war entailed.  

Aside from all that, I abhor gun violence & political violence. Violence only begets more violence. However, Charlie Kirk was a vile man-child and I will not shed a tear for him or his family.

one of the most sobering ones i've ever seen was police bodycam footage of an officer walking through school hallways looking for an active shooter (i don't recall which one- another testament to how horrible a state the country is in with respect to mass shootings). this one had graphic scenes blurred, but when i saw the color and general shape of what was a dead child (one of multiple) on the side of the hall way that the officer was walking through, it *still* profoundly hit me like a brick wall.

ndlyjcm,1ne4ymh,1ne4ymh,chrisdh79,"From the article: The last 10 days have brought a string of patent wins for Nintendo. Yesterday, the company was granted US patent 12,409,387, a patent covering riding and flying systems similar to those Nintendo has been criticized for claiming in its Palworld lawsuit (via Gamesfray). Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397, a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance.

According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law.

""Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents,"" said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. ""They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system.""

Sigmon, who we spoke with last year about the claims and potential consequences of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit, said both this week's '387 patent and last week's '397 represent procedural irregularities in the decisionmaking of US patent officials. And thanks to those irregularities, Nintendo has yet more tools to bully its competitors.

The '387 patent granted this week, Sigmon told PC Gamer, ""got a bit of push-back, but barely."" After its initial application was deemed invalid due to similarities to existing Tencent and Xbox-related patents, Nintendo amended its claims based on interviews with the USPTO, which then determined that the claims were allowable ""for substantially the same reasons as parent application(s).""

""That parent case,"" Sigmon said, ""had an even weirder and much less useful prosecution history.""

Most of the claims made in the '387 patent's single parent case, US Pat. No. 12,246,255, were immediately allowed by the USPTO, which Sigmon said is ""a very unusual result: most claims are rejected at least once."" When the claims were ultimately allowed, the only reasoning the USPTO offered was a block quote of text from the claims themselves.

""This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely,"" Sigmon said. ""I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable.""",103,1757585732.0,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ne4ymh/an_embarrassing_failure_of_the_us_patent_system/ndlyjcm/,True,0,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:26:04.359797+00:00,technology

ndm0jls,1ne4ymh,1ne4ymh,sax87ton,"So, it is weird that they allowed the patent at all, they usually don’t allow you to patent game mechanics. 

That said the patent is incredibly specific requiring you to have multiple battle systems that are triggered in different specific contexts (the full control battles and the auto battles from s/v) so even like temtem is safe. 

Hell you could literally rip off all the legends arceus mechanics and still be fine because iirc they don’t have an auto battle function in that one. I don’t believe you can move the pokemon once released which means you can’t violate clause 6

And even then it specifies which system is used on which context. 

So you’d basically have to be exactly ripping off the s/v system. 

That said. The us patent system works in a weird way where getting a patent doesn’t make the patent valid. It is only validated when it is taken to court, so even if you violate the patent you can still likely win the court case.

Frankly I don’t even think Palworld runs a foul of this patent but I haven’t actually played it. Iirc you only get full control of a pal if you ride it which is an entirely separate context that what is described in clause 4",43,1757586764.0,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ne4ymh/an_embarrassing_failure_of_the_us_patent_system/ndm0jls/,False,0,0,,True,2025-09-11T20:26:04.359811+00:00,technology

The patent office doesn’t do deep investigations; it mostly leaves challenges up to the courts. Apple even patented multitouch, even though they didn’t invent it and that patent was later invalidated.

ndmmnd3,1ne4ymh,1ne4ymh,Hazel-Rah,"I posted this in another thread, but it bears repeating here:

Any article written about a patent that doesn't include the claims, an explanation of what they mean, and a brief statement that for a patent to be infringed, *all* features described in the claim must be present, exists solely to rile you up and make you angry.

Here is the first independent claim from the patent.

>1) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:

>(2) performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;

>(3) performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and

>(4) when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and

>(5) when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and

>(6) performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.

*This patent is not about summoning characters to fight*. It is about what type of battle is started, dependent on whether there is an enemy where you summon them. If there is an enemy there, start a manual battle, if there is no enemy, have the summon run off in a predetermined direction, and start an automatically resolved battle.",12,1757595785.0,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ne4ymh/an_embarrassing_failure_of_the_us_patent_system/ndmmnd3/,False,0,0,,True,2025-09-11T20:26:04.359828+00:00,technology

ndmbdv1,1ne6rkk,1ne6rkk,Wagamaga,"Has there ever been an invention which changed the course of human history as much as the world wide web?


It is now 36 years old, an integral part of our daily lives, which has grown far beyond what its British creator Tim Berners-Lee might have imagined for it back in 1989.


“Well, it’s been quite a rollercoaster journey from the initial explosion of it,"" he said.


Although it could have earned him a fortune had he patented it, Sir Tim Berners-Lee gave his invention away for free. The ability for everybody to have access to the vast network of information offered on the web was very important to him. He conceived the web as a means of connecting ideas rather than making money.


Of course, today the web is the source of revenue for some of the world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.


One way they have been able to make this much money is by using algorithms, which learn from our data to attract and keep our attention.


One of the most effective ways to do this is to elicit emotion - most often negative emotions like rage.


Tim Berners-Lee explains that social media networks employ deceptive algorithms which can feed you more and more horrible stuff and essentially then make money out of doing that.


So, is it possible to stop that from happening?


“I think there's a lot of evidence that polarisation in general is due to the social media platforms,"" said Berners-Lee.


""The systems are trained to keep people on the platform, so they're rewarded when somebody stays on the platform because of, for example, some hate speech. One of the things we could do is we could outlaw that. We could say you can make social media platforms; the only thing you can’t do is make them addictive.”


But is that really enforceable? “Well, you have to tell them it’s illegal,” he said.",134,1757591654.0,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ne6rkk/addictive_algorithms_should_be_illegal_says/ndmbdv1/,True,0,0,,True,2025-09-11T20:26:06.493428+00:00,technology

1 Any app or UI flow,  neural network based or otherwise, wherein > x% of randomly tested users report > y% reduction in self-rated happiness on a 1/10 scale, when not interacting with the algorithm, wip

2 As these are based on your usage history within the app and across the internet, legal limits on how long of a history of user data can be referenced by an algorithm, neural network based or otherwise.

(If the user is 40 years old, does not  mean that meta should be allowed to use 15 odd years of their interactions to feed them more content. Stopping this practice would make any recc algorithm less addictive imo. 

On the flip side, allowing the use of infinite user history to continue as is, will cause older people to be fed increasingly more addictive content as their longer and longer interaction histories with the internet help the algo hook them more easily through fine tuned content, than it can younger individuals who have less personal data available for the algo simply on account of having been online for fewer years)

People respond to things that elicit emotion, clickbait exists because of this very human phenomenon.  This very easily leads to a feedback loop where even if that algorithm isn't explicitly pushing 'toxic' content, it will still be served to people because that is what they most often engage with.  

Look at Reddit, and see how much content that ends up on r/all is rage bait or otherwise 'emotional' content.  There is no algorithm, this is what people are organically upvoting, and it doesn't look much different than any other platform IMO.

So the options then become strict content moderation and restriction, or users moderating their own behavior.  I personally don't favor the former.  Trying to define what even is 'addictive social media' to make it illegal, is opening pandoras box IMO.

ndnaqua,1ne6rkk,ndmtisp,HasGreatVocabulary,"Each method has flaws as it is a reddit comment, but for number 3, which I like most, note that it avoids blaming gamers or instagram users and takes it as a fact that some people will choose to spend a lot of time on some application or other. At the individual level, people shoudl be free to spend as much time as they like on video games or apps or anything else. The problem is of incentives on the broader economy.

Say, for the sake of studying it, we pretend we have a small economy with 100 gamers, and we have a single player video game studio that makes a fantastic and justifiably pretty addictive video game because it is high quality, and lets say it has all our 100 gamers fully locked in, i.e. we will say each of the 100 gamers plays for 8 hours of the day every day. Stay with me. 

That is 100 users \* 8 hours = 800 hours/day spent gaming. This not a problem, if all these 100 people are ok with this use of their time. Some might see this monopolization of time by a single company as a problem, but I see it is not the main problem. The problem is of incentive and about which strategies a company will choose in order to make profit, given the large variety of options they could go with.

As we defined it, the above company gets no additional money by having their players spend 8 hours of the day playing the game.

They made a great game, people bought it for fixed amount of money, and are enjoying it as much as they wish to. The company with the above financial structure has no incentive to make a game that people spend increasing amounts of time each day, nor does it have an incentive to make choices that trap people in a dopamine loop. 

  
Now imagine a company makes a new and awesome addictive game that all of that 100 gamer user base now plays 8 hours of the day, but in this case, because of the wonders of targeted advertising, we say this company makes $7.50 for the company for every hour spent by a user on that game. The game is free, the users pay nothing, the company only makes money while people keep playing. 

A company with the above financial structure has huge incentive to make a game/app that people spend increasing hours of time on. It makes 800\*7.50 = $6000 per day, while the other company make nothing. They will obviously focus on app addiction as a strategy. How do you, as a government or activist, stop them for focusing on addiction as a profit strategy when it is so so easy to make money this way? 



That is, the question is about what society/governments should do when one or two companies are making infinite money pile simply because they are best at pushing the human dopamine addiction button repeatedly for long periods of time, keeping eyeballs locked onto the small rectangle as long s possible, and in fact, cannot  make profits nor survive without that parasitic strategy. 

That question is fair to ask I think, considering we have seen clear evidence of social division and app addiction in the last 15 years, as well as evidence of how companies like meta specifically study and target our biological/neural responses to stimuli like scientists studying mice in order to keep the party going.",1,1757603238.0,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ne6rkk/addictive_algorithms_should_be_illegal_says/ndnaqua/,False,2,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:26:06.493795+00:00,technology
