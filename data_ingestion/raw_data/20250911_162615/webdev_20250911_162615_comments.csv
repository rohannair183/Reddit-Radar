ncxx7rp,1n5msjg,1n5msjg,Ok-Pollution9,"Hi there frens!I have a few questions. Recently I came up with the idea for a web3 application, and I immediately started looking into what I would need for development.

It turns out there’s an SDK for the blockchain I want to use (for my idea) written in TypeScript, so I decided that my backend will be in TS. The problem is, I don’t really know where to start.

The reason is there are so many things to figure out before I can actually start coding — I feel like I first need to decide \_how\_ it will all work:

\- Architecture – should it be a single app in one directory (both front + back) or separate front and back communicating via API requests?

\- API – should I use REST or GraphQL?

\- Database – MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc?

\- Frontend – which framework or library should I choose? (I’m leaning toward React because it looks well-documented at first glance.)

\- how do I combine all of these? Where do I start?

I already downloaded Node.js, I understand the basics of \`package.json\` and how to start a Node project, but that’s as far as I got.

The problem is I don’t have enough experience to make these decisions. When I search for information, I can only find resources that cover each part separately. What I’m looking for is more of an “all-in-one” guide that explains how these things fit together.

I have been developing embedded and desktop software for around 20 years now. I switched companies and industries, and am now in charge of building a new, internal webapp for the company. I am completely free on chosing the tech stack, and am the sole developer on the project.

While I have much experience with embedded dev on microprocessors and microcontrollers (C++/C) and desktop application development (delphi/lazarus), my web programming skills are very basic. I know python and have worked on a django backend before, but absolutely no frontend development experience.

The application I have to write is going to be rather complex over time, with a lot of things going on frontend wise. It's basically only CRUD, but with a lot of interactivity. It's supposed to be an inventory management software, with all the bells and whistles.

I have dabbled around in vanilla js, but I find it a bit cumbersome (missing types being a big issue for me). Also, I feel it's quite verbose, I need to write a lot of code to get very little done. But maybe that's just frontend webdev work in general vs embedded dev or desktop dev, I am not sure yet.

nbw37fd,1n5msjg,nbv9gbt,kixxauth,"My advice is to try to capture the value you have created for the buyer in the price. That's often very difficult to do. I know most designers/developers charge by the hour, but I would actually advise against that. Charging by the hour commoditizes you and makes it difficult to sell what you do as a product vs. just a contractor.

Instead, I've take other approaches that work well depending on the project:

1. If it's small, I just build it, and do several revisions with the customer. Based on getting to know the customer better I decide on a 1 time price and a yearly hosting fee. I try to base this on the value I can provide their business and how much they can realistically afford. If they can't meet my price, I might negotiate, but not much. If they won't pay it, then I lose a week of my time, at most. I can't remember ever losing a week of time when I did this.

2. For bigger projects I break it down into milestones and charge for each milestone. I don't ship the milestone until they pay for it. I give them plenty of time to give feedback on each milestone. I usually also charge for hosting in this scenario too.

I have only had 1 issue in this second scenario. A customer wanted to ship a billing feature in a milestone, but I told them that milestone was closed and would have to wait for the next one. The customer became irate, and I called them later that day and said I didn't want to work with them anymore. This didn't go over very well.

If they just need a website to get found, it’s probably not worth much. But if their website collects leads and contains a chat feature, it’s probably worth much more to them.

Get a sense of what their biggest problems are, and you’ll also get a sense of how much it’s worth to solve them

Example: I did a site for a hockey team, and learned that entering stats for the players into their old site was very painful. I set up a login system so the scoresheets could be easily entered after each game in the new site, which everyone was really happy with.

I knew roughly how much the business made each year, and how much they could afford. They were thrilled with the new stats system and happy to stretch their budget to pay for it",1,1756757665.0,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1n5msjg/monthly_getting_started_web_dev_career_thread/nbwb6hr/,False,3,0,,False,2025-09-11T20:24:25.817054+00:00,webdev

Developers might have a rudimentary idea of how the logic behind this magic works, but they don't know nor can't contribute meaningfully in this field. And this is fine, there are many expertises within software engineering.

> I don't use co-pilot or any IDE agents, never tried cursor or claude-code

But you know programming right ? And you know how to learn using a program right ?  Presto, problem solved, you can learn any of these things by just using them for a short period. I would suggest to get an idea of how prompting works (as that is the skill, not so much having experience with a particular agent inside a particular IDE) and then realise that the output is _code_. Code that you are supposed to be able to interpret and correct because you're a programmer.

> building products ""Powered by AI""

That is just a tagline which will be a short term fad. People quickly catch on when products don't solve a problem they are having, and therefor aren't useful to them _no matter what cutting edge features they are allegedly using_: AI is not a product by definition. It is a tool that can be leveraged to solve a problem. That problem solving thing is what is the actual _valuable feature of a product_.

Not quite. When someone visits your website, they are sending IP packets back and forth from their machine to yours through a network of dozens of other machines. Each of those machines uses energy, and you don't necessarily know whether it's from renewables or not. Estimates for the energy use of those intermediary devices vary wildly, but I did a project on this in college, and from what I was able to find then it seemed like it would usually be higher than the energy use of the server (depending on how much work the server is doing for each request, of course). So whether your server is ""green"" or not may not matter as much as the amount of data you're sending (and how far it has to travel).


Here's an article about it:
