1ndj5vz,"I decoupled FastAPI dependency injection system in pure python, no dependencies.","**What My Project Does**

When building FastAPI endpoints, I found the dependency injection system such a pleasure to use that I wanted it everywhere, not just in my endpoints. I explored a few libraries that promised similar functionality, but each had drawbacks, some required Pydantic, others bundled in features beyond dependency injection, and many were riddled with bugs.

That's way I created [PyDepends](https://github.com/entropy-flux/PyDepends), a lightweight dependency injection system that I now use in my own projects and would like to share with you.

**Target Audience**  
This is mainly aimed at:

* FastAPI developers who want to use dependency injection in the service layer.

* Domain-Driven Design practitioners who want to decouple their services from infrastructure.

* Python developers who aren’t building API endpoints but would still like to use dependency injection in their projects.
It’s not production-grade yet, but it’s stable enough for everyday use and easy to extend.

**Comparison**  

Compared to other similar packages, it does just that, inject dependencies, is not bloated with other functionalities. 

* FastDepends: I started out with this for another library I was using but had to ditch it because of the bugs. I even opened a pull request fixing the issue, but it wasn’t taken into account. It also cannot be used with non-serializable classes, and I wanted to inject machine learning models into services. On top of that, it does unpredictable things beyond dependency injection.

1ndm9zl,"Update: Python-based MTG Commander Deck Builder — Now With Combos, Bracket Enforcement, and Include/","Hi r/Python, I wanted to share another update on my Python-based project: a **Magic: The Gathering Commander deck builder**. My first post here was when I had a mostly command-line tool; then I moved to a basic web interface. Since then I’ve added quite a few new features, cleaned up the backend, and expanded both the web and CLI sides.

# What My Project Does

* Pick a commander and up to three themes (e.g., Aristocrats, +1/+1, Kindred, Aggro).
* The builder generates a complete 100-card list with stage-by-stage reasoning.
* Handles multi-copy strategies (Petitioners, Dragon’s Approach, Shadowborn Apostle) with packages that keep the deck at 100 and adjust land counts automatically.
* Lets you lock favorite cards, reroll just creatures/spells/lands, or swap cards for alternatives.
* Supports “owned-only” and “prefer owned” builds by uploading TXT/CSV lists of your collection.
* Exports to TXT (Moxfield/Archidekt), CSV with tags/Owned info, or a simple printout.

# Target Audience

* **Magic: The Gathering players** who like to theorycraft and spin up decks quickly.
* People who want to give a few high-level instructions (commander, themes, composition) and get a playable decklist back.
* Developers or hobbyists interested in Python projects that mix data handling, web UI, and CLI tooling.

# Comparison

I built this because I wasn’t finding much in the way of Python-based, “hands-off” deck builders. Tools like EDHRec, Moxfield, and Archidekt are great, but they generally need a lot of manual input. My approach is closer to: “give me a commander and some themes, generate a deck, and let me iterate fast.” It also lets me compare multiple builds for the same commander or themes to see how choices shift.

# What’s New

* **Combos & Synergies:** detects curated two-card combos, surfaces them in the web UI with badges, and honors color identity.
* **Bracket Compliance:** validates decks against configurable bracket rules (like tutors/extra turns); includes inline enforcement and optional auto-fixing.
* **Include/Exclude Lists:** add must-have or must-exclude cards via text/file input; supports fuzzy matching, EDH color checks, and JSON import/export.
* **Web UI Polish:** improved New Deck modal, integrated multi-copy suggestions, cleaner alternatives panel, and mobile-friendly layouts.
* **CLI Parity:** theme selection by name, deck composition flags (`--land-count`, `--wipe-count`, etc.), and full include/exclude support with detailed console summaries.
* **Performance & Stability:** exclude filtering benchmarked under 50ms on 20k+ cards; Docker image seeds defaults automatically; fixes for land counts, exports mismatches, and mobile scaling quirks.

# Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.x with structured logging, modular orchestration, and test suite for validation and backward compatibility.
* **Web:** Flask + Jinja templates, partial caching, validation endpoints, and Playwright end-to-end tests.
* **CLI:** argparse interface with type indicators, grouped help, and full parity with web features.
* **Deployment:** Docker with multi-arch builds (x86/ARM), sample docker-compose configs.

# Try it

* Live demo: [deck-builder.wiz-ops.com](https://deck-builder.wiz-ops.com/) (setup may take a minute).
* Docker Hub (easiest): [mwisnowski/mtg-python-deckbuilder](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwisnowski/mtg-python-deckbuilder)
* Source & releases: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mwisnowski/mtg_python_deckbuilder)

# Roadmap

* Budget mode with price caps and recommended pickup lists.
* Smarter land base profiles tuned by curve and pip breakdown.
* Random build modes (“surprise me,” random by theme, or full random).

This is my first real “from-scratch” software project, so if you have thoughts on the Python side — code structure, testing, deployment — I’d love to hear them.

Do you want me to keep this **balanced between MTG features and technical notes**, or make it **more developer-focused** (leaning heavier on Python design decisions, logging, testing, etc.) since it’s for r/Python?",Python,styrofoamshotgun,3,1.0,0,1757528911.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndm9zl/update_pythonbased_mtg_commander_deck_builder_now/,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndm9zl/update_pythonbased_mtg_commander_deck_builder_now/,Showcase,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:28:58.153069+00:00
1ncmlwv,Should I give away my app to my employer for free?,"I work for a fintech company in the UK (in operations to be specific) however my daily role doesn’t require any coding knowledge. I have built up some python knowledge over the past few years and have developed an app that far outperforms the workflow tool my company currently uses. I have given hints to my manager that I have some coding knowledge and given them snippets of the tool I’ve created, she’s pretty much given me free reign to stop any of my usual tasks and focus on this full time. My partner used to work for the same company in the finance department so I know they paid over £200k for 3 people to develop the current workflow tool (these developers had no operations experience so built something unfit for purpose). I’ve estimated if I can get my app functional it would save the company £20k per month (due to all the manual work we usually have to do vs what I can automate). My manager has already said this puts me in a good position for a decent bonus next year (it wouldn’t be anymore than £10k) so I’m a little stuck on what to do and if I’m sounding greedy. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar position?

1ndgpwv,Curious about moving from Mechanical Engineering to Data Science," Hey everyone,

I’m wrapping up my final year in **Mechanical Engineering**, and lately I’ve been fascinated by how data is shaping decisions in engineering, manufacturing, and beyond. The more I read about **data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling**, the more I feel drawn to explore this path.

My background is heavy on problem-solving, math, and physics, and I’ve done some basic coding in Python and MATLAB for academic projects. I’m now experimenting with SQL and data visualization tools, and I’m considering building small projects that combine engineering concepts with data insights.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve made a similar shift:

* What was the most valuable skill or habit you developed early on?
* Did you start in a data-related role within your original industry, or switch fields entirely?
* Any project ideas that helped you stand out when you were starting out?

1nds31l,[ANNOUNCEMENT] pychub: A new way to ship your Python wheels + deps + extras,"Hey fellow deveopers!  
  
I built a packaging tool called [**pychub**](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub) that might fill a weird little gap you didn’t know you had. It came out of me needing a clean way to distribute Python wheels *with* all of their dependencies and optional extras, but *without* having to freeze them into platform-specific binaries like PyInstaller does. And if you want to just install everything into your own current environment?  That's what I wanted, too.

# So what is it?

**pychub** takes your wheel, resolves and downloads its dependencies, and wraps everything into a single executable `.chub` file. That file can then be shipped/copied anywhere, and then run directly like this:

    python yourtool.chub

It installs into the current environment (or a venv, or a conda env, your call), and can even run an entrypoint function or console script *right after* install.

No network calls. No pip. No virtualenv setup. Just `python tool.chub` and go.

# Why I built it:

Most of the Python packaging tools out there either:

* Freeze the whole thing into a binary (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer) — which is great, until you hit platform issues or need to debug something. Or you just want to do something different than that.
* Just stop at building a wheel and leave it up to you (or your users) to figure out installation, dependencies, and environment prep.

I wanted something in between: still using the host Python interpreter (so it stays light and portable), but with everything pre-downloaded and reproducible.

# What it can bundle:

* Your main wheel
* Any number of additional wheels
* All their dependencies (downloaded and stored locally)
* Optional include files (configs, docs, whatever)
* Pre-install and post-install scripts (shell, Python, etc.)

And it’s 100% reproducible, so that the archive installs the exact same versions every time, no network access needed.

# Build tool integration:

If you're using **Poetry**, **Hatch**, or **PDM**, I’ve released plugins for all three:

* Just add the plugin to your `pyproject.toml`
* Specify your build details (main wheel, includes, scripts, etc.)
* Run your normal build command and you’ll get a `.chub` alongside your `.whl`

It’s one of the easiest ways to ship Python tools that *just work,* whether you're distributing internally, packaging for air-gapped environments, or dropping into Docker builder stages.

Plugins repo:  [https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins)

# Why not just use some other bundling/packaging tool?

Well, depending on your needs, maybe you should! I don’t think pychub replaces everything. It just solves a different problem.

If you want sealed apps with bundled runtimes, use PEX or PyOxidizer.  
If you're distributing scripts, zipapp is great.  
But if you want a **wheel-based**, network-free, single-file installer that works on any Python 3.9+ environment, then pychub might be the right tool.

Full comparison table along with everything else:  
📘 [README on GitHub](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub#why-not-just-use-insert-favorite-tool-name-here)

That’s it. I built it because I needed it to include plugins for a platform that I am building. If it helps you too, even better.  I will be actively supporting this, and if you would like to take it for a spin and see if you like it, I'd be honored to hear your feedback. If you want a feature added, etc, please let me know.  
Issues, suggestions, and PRs are all welcome.

Thanks for your time and interest!

1nd1go9,I created a pretty-printed dir function to make debugging complex classes easier,"**What My Project Does**

You can check it out on github: [https://pypi.org/project/pretty-dir/](https://pypi.org/project/pretty-dir/)

This library generates a better **dir** output for debugging. For a quick example, check out the [with dir](https://github.com/douglassimonsen/ppdir/raw/main/example_images/before.png) and [with ppdir](https://github.com/douglassimonsen/ppdir/raw/main/example_images/after.png) outputs using a simple pydantic model.

  
**Target Audience**

This is mainly aimed at developers who are debugging code that uses any libraries that have large, complex, deeply nested classes. Libraries such as pydantic, dataclasses, and openpyxl.

**Comparison**

It exists in a similar niche as icecream and rich.inspect where it's meant to improve the debugging experience. Unlike similar libraries, this only shows the structure, not the values themselves. This is valuable in pydantic environments, where instances can be too verbose to be meaningful when printed to the console.

**Details**

The library uses the output of the **dir(obj)** function as a baseline, but improves the output in a number of ways:

* Visually groups the methods and attributes by the classes they were defined on. Therefore, if you're subclassing the [pydantic.BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) class, it separates the generic basemodel methods from the subclass' specific methods.
* Pulls the first line of the docstrings for the class, all methods, and all class attributes.
* Can enable showing the function signature for all class methods
* By default, hides private and and dunder methods from the outputs
* Prints the source code location of all parent classes
* Uses [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) to color the different sections of the output

I've set it to automatically import (see **Auto-loading in PDB (Breakpoint)** on PyPI) when I use breakpoint() and it's been a nice quality of life improvement!

1ncy8av,Most Performant Python Compilers/Transpilers in 2025,"Today I find myself in the unfortunate position to create a program that must compile arbitrary python code :(  For the use case I am facing now performance is everything, and luckily the target OS for the executable file will only be linux. The compiled codes will be standalone local computational tools without any frills (no guis, no i|o or r|w operations, no system access, and no backend or configuration needs to pull in). Python code is >=3.8 and can pull in external libraries (eg: numpy). However, the codes may be multithreaded/multiprocessed and any static type-like behavior is not guaranteed.

Historically I have used tools like pyinstaller, py2exe, py2app, which work robustly, but create stand alone executable files that are often pretty slow. I have been looking at a host of transpilers instead, eg: [https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file), and am somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of choices therein. Going through stackoverflow naturally recovered a lot of great recommendations that were go-to's 10-20 years ago, but do not have much promise for recent python versions. Currently I am considering:  
wax [https://github.com/LingDong-/wax](https://github.com/LingDong-/wax) ,  
11l-lang [https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/](https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/),

rpython [https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),  
or py14  https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14.  
However, this is a lot to consider without rigorously testing all of them out. Does anyone on this sub have experience in modern Transpilers or other techniques for compiling numerical python codes for linux? If so, can you share any tools, techniques, or general guidance? Thank you!

Edit for clarification:  
This will be placed in a user facing application wherein users can upload their tools to be autonomously deployed in a on demand/dynamic runtime basis.

1ndhycj,AI-Rulez v2.0: Universal AI Assistant Configuration Management,"I'm happy to showcase AI-Rulez v2, which is a major next step in the development of this tool. 

**The Problem:** If you're using multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot), you've probably noticed the configuration fragmentation. Each tool demands its own format - `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone.

**The Solution:** AI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. It's like having a build system for AI context.

## Why This Matters for Development Teams

Teams using AI assistants face common challenges:
- **Multiple tools, multiple configs**: Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions
- **Framework-specific standards**: Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management (uv, poetry, npm, etc.)  
- **Monorepo complexity**: Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts
- **Team consistency**: Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors

AI-Rulez solves this with a single `ai-rulez.yaml` that understands your project's conventions.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Project Analysis
The `init` command is where AI-Rulez shines. Instead of manually writing configurations, let AI analyze your codebase:

```bash
# AI analyzes your codebase and generates tailored config
uvx ai-rulez init ""My Project"" --preset popular --use-agent claude --yes
```

This automatically:
- Detects your tech stack (Python/Node/Go, testing frameworks, linters)
- Identifies project patterns and conventions
- Generates appropriate coding standards and practices
- Creates specialized agents for different tasks (code review, testing, docs)
- **Automatically adds all generated AI files to .gitignore** - no more committing `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md` by accident

### Universal Output Generation
One YAML config generates files for every tool:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
metadata:
  name: ""Python API Service""

presets:
  - ""popular""  # Auto-configures Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot

rules:
  - name: ""Python Type Safety""
    priority: critical
    content: |
      - Python 3.11+ with complete type annotations
      - Use | for unions: str | None not Optional[str]
      - mypy strict mode required
      - Type all function signatures and returns

  - name: ""Testing Standards""
    priority: high
    content: |
      - pytest with async support and fixtures
      - 100% coverage for new code
      - Use factory_boy for test data
      - Integration tests with real PostgreSQL

agents:
  - name: ""python-reviewer""
    description: ""Python code review specialist""
    system_prompt: ""Focus on type safety, performance, and Pythonic patterns""
```

Run `uvx ai-rulez generate` and get:
- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` for Cursor
- `.windsurfrules` for Windsurf  
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot
- Custom formats for any future AI tool

### Advanced Features

**MCP Server Integration**: Direct integration with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools:
```bash
# Start built-in MCP server with 19 configuration management tools
uvx ai-rulez mcp
```

**Comprehensive CLI**: Manage configs without editing YAML:
```bash
# Add Python-specific rules on the fly
uvx ai-rulez add rule ""FastAPI Standards"" --priority high --content ""Use Pydantic v2 models with Field validation""

# Create specialized agents
uvx ai-rulez add agent ""pytest-expert"" --description ""Testing specialist for Python projects""
```

**Team Collaboration**: 
- Remote config includes: `includes: [""https://github.com/myorg/python-standards.yaml""]`
- Local overrides: Personal customization via `.local.yaml` files
- Monorepo support: `--recursive` flag handles complex Python projects

### Enterprise Features

**Security & Compliance**:
- SSRF protection for remote config includes
- Schema validation prevents configuration errors
- Audit trails for configuration changes

**Performance**:
- Written in Go - instant startup even for large Python monorepos
- Concurrent generation for multiple output files

```

## Real-World Example

Here's how a Django + React monorepo benefits from AI-Rulez:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
extends: ""https://github.com/myorg/python-base.yaml""

sections:
  - name: ""Architecture""
    content: |
      - Django REST API backend with PostgreSQL
      - React TypeScript frontend
      - Celery for async tasks
      - Docker containerization

agents:
  - name: ""django-expert""
    system_prompt: ""Django specialist focusing on DRF, ORM optimization, and security""
  
  - name: ""frontend-reviewer""  
    system_prompt: ""React/TypeScript expert for component architecture and testing""

mcp_servers:
  - name: ""database-tools""
    command: ""uvx""
    args: [""mcp-server-postgres""]
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ""postgresql://localhost/myproject""
```

This generates tailored configurations for each AI tool, ensuring consistent guidance whether you're working on Django models or React components.

1nckydw,Cythonize Python Code,"# Context

This is my first time messing with **Cython** (or really anything related to optimizing Python code).  
I usually just stick with yielding and avoiding keeping much in memory, so bear with me.

# Context

I’m building a Python project that’s kind of like `zipgrep` / `ugrep`.  
It streams through archive(s) file contents (nothing kept in memory) and searches for whatever pattern is passed in.

# Benchmarks

(Results vary depending on the pattern, hence the wide gap)

* ✅ **\~15–30x faster** than `zipgrep` (expected)
* ❌ **\~2–8x slower** than `ugrep` (also expected, since it’s C++ and much faster)

I tried:

* `cythonize` from [`Cython.Build`](http://Cython.Build) with setuptools
* Nuitka

But the performance was basically identical in both cases. I didn’t see any difference at all.  
Maybe I compiled Cython/Nuitka incorrectly, even though they both built successfully?

# Question

Is it actually worth:

* Manually writing `.c` files
* Switching the right parts over to `cdef`

Or is this just one of those cases where Python’s overhead will always keep it behind something like `ugrep`?

1ncn5fq,imgbatch – A Python tool for batch-processing images from the command line,"**What My Project Does**

[https://github.com/booo2233/imgbatch](https://github.com/booo2233/imgbatch)

 is a simple Python tool that lets you batch-process images (resize, compress, or convert formats) directly from the command line. Instead of opening heavy software, you can point it at a folder and quickly process all your images in one go.

**Target Audience**  
This is mainly aimed at:

* Developers who need quick image preprocessing for projects
* Photographers or designers who want to resize/compress many images at once
* Anyone who prefers lightweight CLI tools instead of GUIs

It’s not production-grade yet, but it’s stable enough for everyday use and easy to extend.

**Comparison**  
Compared to tools like ImageMagick or Pillow scripts:

* imgbatch is **simpler** (minimal commands, no need to learn a big toolset)
* It’s **focused only on batch tasks** (not a general-purpose graphics library)
* Written in Python, so easy to tweak or add custom functions if you know a little code

1nbkych,Stop building UI frameworks in Python,"7 years back when I started coding, I used Tkinter. Then PyQt. 

I spent some good 2 weeks debating if I should learn Kivy or Java for building an Android app.

Then we've got modern ones: FastUI by Pydantic, NiceGUI (amazing project, it's the closest bet).

Python is great for a lot of things. Just stop abusing it by building (or trying to) UI with it.

Why I am saying this: Because I've tried it all. I've tried every possible way to avoid JavaScript and keep building UIs with Python.

1ncxl3i,Method overloading: in ~30 lines of code. Simple enough?,"Getting into the deeper parts of Python and thought of this simple Metaclass that allows method overloading.

            super().__setitem__(key, value)

            hint = get_type_hints(func)
    
            # Hack to get first (and only) hint...
            for hint in get_type_hints(func).values():

It obviously is only a proof of concept.

1nbkguo,I built a programming language interpreted in Python!,"Hey!

I'd like to share a project I've been working on: A functional programming language that I built entirely in Python.

I'm primarily a Python developer, but I wanted to understand functional programming concepts better. Instead of just reading about them, I decided to build my own FP language from scratch. It started as a tiny DSL (domain specific language) for a specific problem (which it turned out to be terrible for!), but I enjoyed the core ideas enough to expand it into a full functional language.

## What My Project Does

NumFu is a pure functional programming language interpreted in Python featuring:
- **Arbitrary precision arithmetic** using `mpmath` - no floating point issues
- **Automatic partial application** and function composition 
- **Built-in testing syntax** with readable assertions
- **Tail call optimization** for efficient recursion
- **Clean syntax** with only four types (Number, Boolean, List, String)

Here's a taste of the syntax:

```numfu
// Functions automatically partially apply
>>> {a, b, c -> a + b + c}(_, 5)
{a, c -> a+5+c}  // Even prints as readable syntax!

// Composition and pipes
let add1 = {x -> x + 1},
    double = {x -> x * 2}
in 5 |> (add1 >> double) // 12

// Built-in testing
let square = {x -> x * x} in
square(7) ---> $ == 49  // ✓ passes
```

## Target Audience

This is **not** a production language - it's 2-5x slower than Python due to double interpretation. It's more of a learning tool for:
- Teaching functional programming concepts without complex syntax
- Sketching mathematical algorithms where precision matters more than speed
- Understanding how interpreters work

## Comparison

NumFu has much simpler syntax than traditional functional languages like Haskell or ML and no complex type system - just four basic types. It's less powerful but much more approachable. I designed it to make FP concepts accessible without getting bogged down in advanced language features. Think of it as functional programming with training wheels.

## Implementation Details

The implementation is about 3,500 lines of Python using:
- *Lark* for parsing
- *Tree-walking interpreter* - straightforward recursive evaluation  
- *mpmath* for arbitrary precision arithmetic


## Try It Out

```bash
pip install numfu-lang
numfu repl
```

## Links

I actually enjoy web design, so NumFu has a (probably overly fancy) landing page + documentation site. 😅

- Website: https://rphle.github.io/numfu/
- Documentation: https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/

I built this as a learning exercise and it's been fun to work on. Happy to answer questions about design choices or implementation details! I also really appreciate issues and pull requests!

1ncdmvb,cosine=0.91 but answer is wrong. a tiny python MRE for “semantic ≠ embedding” and before/after fix,"What My Project Does

WFGY Problem Map 1.0 is a reasoning-layer “semantic firewall” for python AI pipelines. it defines 16 reproducible failure modes and gives exact fixes without changing infra. for r/Python this post focuses on No.5 semantic ≠ embedding and No.8 retrieval traceability. the point is to show a minimal numpy repro where cosine looks high but the answer is wrong, then apply the before/after firewall idea to make it stick.

---

Target Audience

python folks who ship RAG or search in production. users of faiss, chroma, qdrant, pgvector, or a homegrown numpy knn. if you have logs where neighbors look close but citations point to the wrong section, this is for you.

---

Comparison

most stacks fix errors after generation by adding rerankers or regex. the same failure returns later. the WFGY approach checks the semantic field before generation. if the state is unstable, loop or reset. only a stable state can emit output.

acceptance targets: ΔS(question, context) ≤ 0.45, coverage ≥ 0.70, λ convergent. once these hold, that class of bug stays fixed.

---

Minimal Repro (numpy only)

```

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)
dim = 8

# clean anchors for two topics

A = np.array([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.], dtype=np.float32)
B = np.array([0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.], dtype=np.float32)

# chunks: B cluster is tight, A is sloppy, which fools raw inner product

chunks = np.stack([
    A + 0.20*np.random.randn(dim),
    A + 0.22*np.random.randn(dim),
    B + 0.05*np.random.randn(dim),
    B + 0.05*np.random.randn(dim),
]).astype(np.float32)

def ip_search(q, X, k=2):
    scores = X @ q
    idx = np.argsort(-scores)[:k]
    return idx, scores[idx]

def l2norm(X):
    n = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, keepdims=True) + 1e-12
    return X / n

q = (A + 0.10*np.random.randn(dim)).astype(np.float32)  # should match topic A

# BEFORE: raw inner product, no normalization

top_raw, s_raw = ip_search(q, chunks, k=2)
print(""BEFORE idx:"", top_raw, ""scores:"", np.round(s_raw, 4))

# AFTER: enforce cosine by normalizing both sides

top_cos, s_cos = ip_search(q/np.linalg.norm(q), l2norm(chunks), k=2)
print(""AFTER idx:"", top_cos, ""scores:"", np.round(s_cos, 4))

```

---

on many runs the raw version ranks the tight B cluster above A even though the query is A. enforcing a cosine contract flips it back.

---

Before vs After Fix (what to ship)

1. enforce L2 normalization for both stored vectors and queries when you mean cosine.

2. add a chunk id contract that keeps page or section fields. avoid tiny fragments, normalize casing and width.

3. apply an acceptance gate before you generate. if ΔS or coverage fail, re-retrieve or reset instead of emitting.

1nb5rhw,"lilpipe: a tiny, typed pipeline engine (not a DAG)","At work, I develop data analysis pipelines in Python for the lab teams. Oftentimes, the pipelines are a little too lightweight to justify a full DAG. [lilpipe](https://github.com/andrewruba/lilpipe) is my attempt at the minimum feature set to run those pipelines without extra/unnecessary infrastructure.

# What My Project Does

* Runs sequential, in-process pipelines (not a DAG/orchestrator).
* Shares a typed, Pydantic PipelineContext across steps (assignment-time validation if you want it).
* Skips work via fingerprint caching (fingerprint\_keys).
* Gives simple control signals: ctx.abort\_pass() (retry current pass) and ctx.abort\_pipeline() (stop).
* Lets you compose steps: Step(""name"", children=\[...\]).

# Target Audience

* Data scientists / lab scientists who use notebooks or small scripts and want a shared context across steps.
* Anyone maintaining “glue” scripts that could use caching and simple retry/abort semantics.
* Bio-analytical analysis: load plate → calibrate → QC → report (ie. this project's origin story).
* Data engineers with one-box batch jobs (CSV → clean → export) who don’t want a scheduler and metadata DB (a bit of a stretch, I know).

# Comparison

* Airflow/Dagster/Prefect: Full DAG/orchestrators with schedulers, UIs, state, lineage, retries, SLAs/backfills. lilpipe is intentionally not that. It’s for linear, in-process pipelines where that stack is overkill.
* scikit-learn Pipeline: ML-specific fit/transform/predict on estimators. lilpipe is general purpose steps with a Pydantic context.
* Other lightweight pipeline libraries: don't have the exact features that I use on a day-to-day basis. lilpipe does have those features haha.

1nb8bdn,My Python library to create images from simple layouts,"Hey r/Python,

I'm working on an open-source library for creating images from code. The idea is to build visuals by describing them as simple layouts, instead of calculating `(x, y)` coordinates for everything.

For example, I used it to generate this fake Reddit post card:

[Resulting Image](https://i.imgur.com/JUFXMzK.png)

This whole image was created with the Python code below. It handles all the layout, font fallbacks, text wrapping, and rendering for you.

```python
from pictex import *

# --- 1. Define the small components ---
upvote_icon = Image(""upvote.png"")
downvote_icon = Image(""downvote.png"")
comment_icon = Image(""comment.png"").resize(0.7)
python_icon = Image(""python_logo.png"").size(25, 25).border_radius('50%')

flair = Text(""Showcase"").font_size(12).padding(2, 6).background_color(""#0079D3"").color(""white"").border_radius(10)

# --- 2. Build the layout by composing components ---
vote_section = Column(
    upvote_icon,
    Text(""51"").font_size(40).font_weight(700),
    downvote_icon
).horizontal_align('center').gap(5)

post_header = Row(
    python_icon,
    Text(""r/Python • Posted by u/_unknownProtocol"").font_size(14),
    flair
).gap(8).vertical_align('center')

post_title = Text(
    ""My Python library to create images from simple layouts""
).font_size(22).font_weight(700).line_height(1.2)

post_footer = Row(
    comment_icon,
    Text(""12 Comments"").font_size(14).font_weight(700),
).gap(8).vertical_align('center')

# --- 3. Assemble the final card ---
main_card = Row(
    vote_section.padding(0, 15, 0, 0),
    Column(post_header, post_title, post_footer).gap(10)
).padding(20).background_color(""white"").border_radius(10).size(width=600).box_shadows(
    Shadow(offset=(5, 5), blur_radius=10, color=""#00000033"")
)

# --- 4. Render on a canvas ---
canvas = Canvas().background_color(LinearGradient([""#F0F2F5"", ""#DAE0E6""])).padding(40)
image = canvas.render(main_card)
image.save(""reddit_card.png"")
```

---

### What My Project Does

It's a layout engine that renders to an image. You build your image by nesting components (`Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Image`), and the library figures out all the sizing and positioning for you, using a model inspired by CSS Flexbox. You can style any element with padding, borders, backgrounds, and shadows. It also handles fonts and emojis, automatically finding fallbacks if a character isn't supported.

### Target Audience

It's for any Python dev who wants to create images from code, especially when the content is dynamic. For example:
*   Automating social media posts or quote images.
*   Generating Open Graph images for a website on the fly.
*   Creating parts of an infographic or a report.

The project is currently in Beta. It's pretty solid for most common use cases, but you might still find some rough edges.

### Comparison

*   **vs. Pillow/OpenCV:** Think of Pillow/OpenCV as a digital canvas where you have to specify the exact `(x, y)` coordinates for everything you draw. This library is more of a layout manager: you describe *how* elements should be arranged, and it does the math for you.
*   **vs. HTML/CSS-to-Image libraries:** They're powerful, but they usually require a full web browser engine (like Chrome) to work, which can be a heavy dependency. This library uses Skia directly and is a standard `pip install`.

I'm still working on it, and any feedback or suggestions are very welcome.

1nbugq8,Error en Visual Studio Code: Terminal lenta y problema con la base de datos al usar Flask y GitHub.,"Hola a todos,

Necesito su ayuda con un problema que estoy teniendo con mi proyecto de Python/Flask en Visual Studio Code. He intentado varias cosas, pero no he logrado resolverlo.

Antecedentes del problema

Anteriormente, utilizaba GitHub Desktop para gestionar mis repositorios. De repente, me empezó a dar un error que decía que no podía encontrar el repositorio local, a pesar de que los archivos seguían en mi computadora.

Mi solución temporal fue clonar de nuevo el repositorio, y eso funcionó para GitHub Desktop. Sin embargo, ahora tengo un problema en Visual Studio Code que no sé cómo solucionar.

El problema actual

Terminal excesivamente lenta: Cuando uso la terminal de Visual Studio Code para ejecutar comandos como flask db init o flask run, el proceso se vuelve muy lento. Aunque eventualmente me muestra que el proceso fue exitoso, el tiempo de espera es anormal.

No se visualiza la base de datos: A pesar de que la terminal indica que el comando flask db init se ejecutó correctamente, no puedo ver la base de datos (generalmente un archivo .db) en el explorador de archivos de Visual Studio Code. Es como si el archivo no se estuviera creando o se estuviera creando en un lugar incorrecto, aunque no me lanza ningún error.

Lo que he revisado

Revisé que mi entorno virtual (venv) esté activado correctamente.

Confirmé que los archivos del proyecto, como app.py y config.py, están bien configurados para la base de datos.

Verifiqué que el archivo del repositorio está en el mismo lugar de siempre en mi computadora.

Mis preguntas

¿Podría este problema estar relacionado con la forma en que GitHub Desktop maneja los repositorios?

¿Hay alguna configuración específica en Visual Studio Code que deba revisar?

¿Cómo puedo solucionar la lentitud de la terminal y asegurar que la base de datos se cree y se muestre en mi explorador de archivos?

Agradezco de antemano cualquier sugerencia o ayuda que puedan darme.

1nbmdj7,Aicontextator - A CLI tool to safely bundle your project's code for LLMs,"

Hi,

I'm David. I built Aicontextator to scratch my own itch. I was spending way too much time manually gathering and pasting code files into LLM web UIs. It was tedious, and I was constantly worried about accidentally pasting an API key or another secret.

Aicontextator is a simple CLI tool built with Python that automates this entire process. You run it in your project directory, and it bundles all the relevant files into a single, clean string ready for your prompt.

The GitHub repo is here: [https://github.com/ILDaviz/aicontextator](https://github.com/ILDaviz/aicontextator)

I'd love to get your feedback and suggestions!

**What My Project Does**

Aicontextator is a command-line utility designed to make it easier and safer to provide code context to Large Language Models. Its main features are:

* **Context Bundling:** It recursively finds all files in your project, respects your `.gitignore` rules, and concatenates them into a single string for easy copy-pasting.
* **Security First:** It uses the `detect-secrets` engine to scan every file *before* adding it to the context. If it finds a potential secret (like an API key or password), it warns you and excludes that line, preventing accidental leaks.
* **User-Friendly Features:** It includes an interactive mode to visually select which files to include, a token counter to stay within the LLM's context limit, and the ability to automatically split the output into multiple chunks if the context is too large.

**Target Audience**

This tool is for any developer who regularly uses LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) for coding assistance, debugging, or documentation. It's particularly useful for those working on projects with a non-trivial number of files (e.g., web developers, data scientists, backend engineers) where manually providing context is impractical. It's designed as a practical utility to be integrated into a daily development workflow, not just a toy project.

**Comparison with Alternatives**

* **vs. Manual Copy-Pasting:** This is the most common method, but it's slow, error-prone (it's easy to miss a file), and risky (you might accidentally paste a file like `.env`). Aicontextator automates this, making it fast, comprehensive, and safe.
* **vs. IDE Extensions (e.g., GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor):** These tools are powerful but tie you to a specific editor and often a specific LLM ecosystem. Aicontextator is **editor-agnostic** and **LLM-agnostic**. It generates a simple string that you can use in any web UI or API you prefer, giving you complete flexibility.
* **vs. Other Context-Aware CLI Tools:** Many alternative tools try to be full-fledged chat clients in your terminal. Aicontextator has a much simpler scope: it does one thing and does it well. It focuses solely on **preparing the context**, acting as a powerful pre-processor for any LLM interaction, without forcing you into a specific chat interface.

We now support a comma `style="",""` style which lets use a comma seperate string to specific fields.

    formatter = JsonFormatter(""message,asctime,exc_info"", style="","")

We also using any sequence of strings (e.g. lists or tuples).

    formatter = JsonFormatter([""message"", ""asctime"", ""exc_info""])

# What is Python JSON Logger

If you've not heard of this package, Python JSON Logger enables you produce JSON logs when using Python's `logging` package.

JSON logs are machine readable allowing for much easier parsing and ingestion into log aggregation tools.

For example here is the (formatted) log output of one of my programs:

    {
      ""trace_id"": ""af922f04redacted"",
      ""request_id"": ""cb1499redacted"",
      ""parent_request_id"": null,
      ""message"": ""Successfully imported redacted"",
      ""levelname"": ""INFO"",
      ""name"": ""redacted"",
      ""pathname"": ""/code/src/product_data/consumers/games.py"",
      ""lineno"": 41,
      ""timestamp"": ""2025-09-06T08:00:48.485770+00:00""
    }

Although Python JSON Logger [is in the top 300 downloaded packaged from PyPI](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) (in the last month it's been downloaded more times that UV! ... just), there's not many people watching the repository [after it changed hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcm2rr/pythonjsonlogger_has_changed_hands/) at the end of 2024.

1nag19u,ensures: simple Design by Contract,"* **What My Project Does**

There are a few other packages for this, but I decided to make one that is simple, readable, accepts arbitrary functions, and uses the Result type from functional programming. You can find more details in the readme: [https://github.com/brunodantas/ensures](https://github.com/brunodantas/ensures)

>ensures is a simple Python package that implements the idea of Design by Contract described in the Pragmatic Paranoia chapter of The Pragmatic Programmer. That's the chapter where they say you should trust nobody, not even yourself.

* **Target Audience** (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)

Anyone interested in ~~paranoia~~ decorating functions with precondition functions etc and use a Functional data structure in the process.

I plan to add pytest tests to make this more production-ready. Any feedback is welcome.

* **Comparison** (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)

None of the alternatives I found seem to implement arbitrary functions plus the Result type, while being simple and readable.

But some of the alternatives are icontract, contracts, deal.

1nb05ab,Prompt components - a better library for managing LLM prompts,"I started an Agentic AI company that has recently winded down, and we're happy to open source this library for managing prompts for LLMs!


### What My Project Does

Create components (blocks of text) that can be composed and shared across different prompts. This library enables isolated testing of each component, with support for standard python string formatting and jinja2.

The library came about because we were pulling our hair out trying to re-use different prompts across our codebase.

### Target Audience

This library is for you if you:

\- have written templates for LLMs and want proper type hint support

\- want a clean way to share blocks of text between prompts

### Comparison

Standard template engines lack clear ways to organize shared text between different prompts.

This library utilizes dataclasses to write prompts.

### Dataclasses for composable components

    @dataclass_component
    class InstructionsXml:
        _template = ""<instructions> {text} </instructions>""
        text: str
    
    @dataclass_component
    class Prompt(StringTemplate):
        _template = """"""
        ## AI Role
        {ai_role}
    
        ## Instructions
        {instructions}
        """"""
    
        ai_role: str
        instructions: Instructions
    
    prompt = Prompt(
        ai_role=""You are an expert coder."",
        instructions=Instructions(
           text=""Write python code to satisfy the user's query.""
        )
    )
    print(prompt.render()) # Renders the prompt as a string

The \`InstructionsXml\` component can be used in other prompts and also is easily swapped out! More powerful constructs are possible using dataclass features + jinja2.
