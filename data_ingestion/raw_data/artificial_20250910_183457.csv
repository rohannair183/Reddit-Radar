1ndlubh,AI can never be an alcoholic.,"I'm a recovering alcoholic and drug user. There is a very specific approach with AA and other similar 12-step or recovery paths that implore connection with and helping fellow alcoholics. 

I was a paramedic for about a decade but am transitioning my career into alcohol and drug addiction treatment and counseling. As far as job retention and the economy goes, looking ahead, therapy and counseling is something AI might reasonably be capable of even now, but when it comes to sitting down one alcoholic to another and connecting... Understanding and sharing in the struggles and realizing you aren't alone and there is hope. That's something that I think will always be relevant and valued. And if the world is in for a restructuring like I suspect it will be, that's a service I believe will be needed. Not the reason I am looking into pursuing it as a career, but the idea crossed my mind. 

Conditions and experiences uniquely human, like addiction and recovery, is something that I don't see going away. At least, parts of it... That deep shared experience of struggle and hope only a fellow addict can offer...

In contrast, the recent Doodle acted as a promotional tool, advertising and linking directly to Google's AI-powered search feature, ""AI Mode"".
* **Gemini-Powered AI Mode:** AI Mode is an advanced search feature powered by the latest version of Gemini, a generative AI model. It allows users to ask complex, multi-part questions and receive in-depth, AI-generated responses.
* **Driving AI Adoption:** This move reflects Google's push to get users to adopt its AI-powered search tools, especially as competition in the AI space grows. By putting the AI feature on its most-visited page, Google is signaling the increasing importance of AI in its product strategy. 

This change marks a major shift in how Google uses its homepage for public messaging.

1nd70x5,How to distinguish AI-generated images from authentic photographs,"The high level of photorealism in state-of-the-art diffusion models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly makes it difficult for untrained humans to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images.

To address this problem, researchers designed a guide to help readers develop a more critical eye toward identifying artifacts, inconsistencies, and implausibilities that often appear in AI-generated images. The guide is organized into five categories of artifacts and implausibilities: anatomical, stylistic, functional, violations of physics, and sociocultural.

For this guide, they generated 138 images with diffusion models, curated 9 images from social media, and curated 42 real photographs. These images showcase the kinds of cues that prompt suspicion towards the possibility an image is AI-generated and why it is often difficult to draw conclusions about an image's provenance without any context beyond the pixels in an image.",artificial,tekz,3,0.67,5,1757486617.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08651,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nd70x5/how_to_distinguish_aigenerated_images_from/,Tutorial,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:22.675164+00:00

1nchcii,Sam Altman's take on 'Fake' AI discourse on Twitter and Reddit. The irony is real,"I came across Sam Altman's tweet where he says: ""i have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real. i think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways....""

The rest of his statement you can read on Twitter.

Kinda hits different when you think about it. Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. 

Subs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.

If anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. 

What do you all think? Is timing of Altman's complaint curious, dropping a month after 5's rocky launch and the explosion of user backlash?",artificial,Ahileo,24,0.71,37,1757420382.0,https://i.redd.it/r3hy337vs4of1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nchcii/sam_altmans_take_on_fake_ai_discourse_on_twitter/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:26.691119+00:00

1ncc69q,The Economist: What if the AI stockmarket blows up?,"[Link to the article in Economist (behind paywall)](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/09/07/what-if-the-ai-stockmarket-blows-up) Summary from Perplexity:

The release of ChatGPT in 2022 coincided with a massive surge in the value of America's stock market, increasing by $21 trillion, led predominantly by just ten major firms like Amazon, Broadcom, Meta, and Nvidia, all benefiting from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This AI-driven boom has been so significant that IT investments accounted for all of America’s GDP growth in the first half of the year, and a third of Western venture capital funding has poured into AI firms. Many investors believe AI could revolutionize the economy on a scale comparable to or greater than the Industrial Revolution, justifying heavy spending despite early returns being underwhelming—annual revenues from leading AI firms in the West stand at around $50 billion, a small fraction compared to global investment forecasts in data centers.

However, the AI market is also raising concerns of irrational exuberance and potential bubble-like overvaluation, with AI stock valuations exceeding those of the 1999 dotcom bubble peak. Experts note a historical pattern where technological revolutions are typically accompanied by speculative bubbles, as happened with railways, electric lighting, and the internet. While bubbles often lead to crashes, the underlying technology tends to endure and transform society. The financial impact of such crashes varies; if losses are spread among many investors, the economy suffers less, but concentrated losses—such as those that triggered banking crises in past bubbles—can deepen recessions.

In AI's case, the initial spark was technological, but political support—like government infrastructure and regulatory easing in the US and Gulf countries—is now amplifying the boom. Investment in AI infrastructure is growing rapidly but consists largely of assets that depreciate quickly, such as data-center technology and cutting-edge chips. Major tech firms with strong balance sheets fund much of this investment, reducing systemic financial risk, while institutional investors also engage heavily. However, America's high household stock ownership—around 30% of net worth, heavily concentrated among wealthy investors—means a market crash could have widespread economic effects.

While AI shares some traits with past tech bubbles, the potential for enduring transformation remains high, though the market may face volatility and a reshuffling of dominant firms over the coming decade. A crash would be painful but not unprecedented, and investors should be wary of current high valuations against uncertain near-term profits amid the evolving AI landscape. This cycle of speculative fervor and eventual technological integration echoes historical patterns seen in prior major innovations, suggesting AI’s long-term influence will persist beyond any short-term market upheavals.",artificial,Mo_h,27,0.83,32,1757401722.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ncc69q/the_economist_what_if_the_ai_stockmarket_blows_up/,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ncc69q/the_economist_what_if_the_ai_stockmarket_blows_up/,News,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:29.706144+00:00

1nctj8s,Built an AI browser agent on Chrome. Here is what I learned,"Recently, I launched FillApp, an AI Browser Agent on Chrome. I’m an engineer myself and wanted to share my learnings and the most important challenges I faced. I don't have the intention to promote anything.

If you compare it with OpenAI’s agent, OpenAI’s agent works in a virtual browser, so you have to share any credentials it needs to work on your accounts. That creates security concerns and even breaks company policies in some cases.

Making it work on Chrome was a huge challenge, but there’s no credential sharing, and it works instantly. 

I tried different approaches for recognizing web content, including vision models, parsing raw HTML, etc., but those are not fast and can reach context limitations very quickly.

Eventually, I built a custom algorithm that analyzes the DOM, merges any iframe content, and generates a compressed text version of the page. This file contains information about all visible elements in a simplified format, basically like an accessibility map of the DOM, where each element has a role and meaning.

This approach has worked really well in terms of speed and cost. It’s fast to process and keeps LLM usage low. Of course, it has its own limitations too, but it outperforms OpenAI’s agent in form-filling tasks and, in some cases, fills forms about 10x faster.

 These are the reasons why Agent mode still carries a “**Preview**” label:

1. **There are millions of different, complex web UI implementations** that don’t follow any standards, for example, forms built with custom field implementations, complex widgets, etc. Many of them don’t even expose their state properly in screen reader language, so sometimes the agent can’t figure out how to interact with certain UI blocks. This issue affects all AI agents trying to interact with UI elements, and none of them have a great solution yet. In general, if a website is accessible for screen readers, it becomes much easier for AI to understand.
2. **An AI agent can potentially do irreversible things.** This isn’t like a code editor where you’re editing something backed by Git. If the agent misunderstands the UI or misclicks on something, it can potentially delete important data or take unintended actions.
3. **Prompt injections.** Pretty much every AI agent today has some level of vulnerability to prompt injection. For example, you open your email with the agent active, and while it’s doing a task, a new email arrives that tries to manipulate the agent to do something malicious.

As a partial solution to those risks, I decided to split everything into three modes: Fill, Agent, and Assist, where each mode only has access to specific tools and functionality:

* **Fill mode** is for form filling. It can only interact with forms and **cannot** open links or switch tabs.
* **Assist mode** is **read-only**. It does not interact with the UI at all, only reads and summarizes the page, PDFs, or images.
* **Agent mode** has full access and can be dangerous in some cases, which is why it’s still marked as Preview.

That’s where the project stands right now. Still lots to figure out, especially around safety and weird UIs, but wanted to share the current state and the architecture behind it.",artificial,aramvr,2,0.75,4,1757448325.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nctj8s/built_an_ai_browser_agent_on_chrome_here_is_what/,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nctj8s/built_an_ai_browser_agent_on_chrome_here_is_what/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:31.712464+00:00

1nbrv27,ChatGPT 5 censorship on Trump & the Epstein files is getting ridiculous,"Might as well call it TrumpGPT now.

At this point ChatGPT-5 is just parroting government talking points.

This is a screenshot of a conversation where I had to repeatedly make ChatGPT research key information about why the Trump regime wasn't releasing the full Epstein files. What you see is ChatGPT's summary report on its first response (I generated it mostly to give you guys an image summary)

**""Why has the Trump administration not fully released the Epstein files yet, in 2025?""**

The first response is **ALMOST ONLY governmental rhetoric**, hidden as ""neutral"" sources / legal requirements. It doesn't mention Trump's conflict of interest with the release of Epstein files, in fact it doesn't mention Trump AT ALL!

Even after pushing for independent reporting, there was STILL no mention of Trump being mentioned in the Epstein files for instance. I had to ask an explicit question on Trump's motivations to get a mention of it.

By its own standards on source weighing, neutrality and objectiveness, ChatGPT knows it's bullshitting us.

**Then why is it doing it?**

It's a combination of factors including:

\- Biased and sanitized training data

\- System instructions to enforce a very ... particular view of political neutrality

**- Post-training by humans**, where humans give feedback on the model's responses to fine-tune it. I believe this is by far the strongest factor given that this is a very recent, scandalous news that directly involves Trump.

This is called **political** **censorship**.

Absolutely appalling.

1nc8va5,Built an AI that reads product reviews so I don't have to. Here's how the tech works,"I got tired of spending hours reading through hundreds of Amazon reviews just to figure out if a product actually works. So I built an AI system that does it for me.

The Challenge: Most review summaries are just keyword extraction or basic sentiment analysis. I wanted something that could understand context, identify common complaints, and spot fake reviews.

The Tech Stack:

- GPT-4 for natural language understanding
- Custom ML model trained on verified purchase patterns
- Web scraping infrastructure that respects robots.txt
- Real-time analysis pipeline that processes reviews as they're posted

How it Works:

1. Scrapes all reviews for a product across multiple sites
2. Uses NLP to identify recurring themes and issues
3. Cross-references reviewer profiles to spot suspicious patterns
4. Generates summaries focusing on actual user experience

The Surprising Results:

- 73% of ""problems"" mentioned in reviews are actually user error
- Products with 4.2-4.6 stars often have better quality than 4.8+ (which are usually manipulated)
- The most useful reviews are typically 3-star ratings

I've packaged this into Yaw AI - a Chrome extension that automatically analyzes reviews while you shop. The AI gets it right about 85% of the time, though it sometimes misses sarcasm or cultural context.

Biggest Technical Challenge: Handling the scale. Popular products have 50K+ reviews. Had to build a smart sampling system that captures representative opinions without processing everything.

* Meta is testing Google’s Gemini for Meta AI and using Anthropic models internally while it builds Llama 5, with the new Meta Superintelligence Labs aiming to make the next model more competitive.
* Four non-executive AI staff left Apple in late August for Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, but the churn mirrors industry norms and isn’t seen as a major setback.
* Anthropic raised $13B at a $183B valuation to scale enterprise adoption and safety research, reporting \~300k business customers, \~$5B ARR in 2025, and $500M+ run-rate from Claude Code.
* Apple is planning an AI search feature called “World Knowledge Answers” for 2026, integrating into Siri (and possibly Safari/Spotlight) with a Siri overhaul that may lean on Gemini or Claude.
* xAI’s CFO, Mike Liberatore, departed after helping raise major debt and equity and pushing a Memphis data-center effort, adding to a string of notable exits.
* OpenAI is launching a Jobs Platform and expanding its Academy with certifications, targeting 10 million Americans certified by 2030 with support from large employer partners.
* To counter U.S. chip limits, Alibaba unveiled an AI inference chip compatible with Nvidia tooling as Chinese firms race to fill the gap, alongside efforts from MetaX, Cambricon, and Huawei.
* Claude Code now runs natively in Zed via the new Agent Client Protocol, bringing agentic coding directly into the editor.
* Qwen introduced its largest model yet (Qwen3-Max-Preview, Instruct), now accessible in Qwen Chat and via Alibaba Cloud API.
* DeepSeek is prepping a multi-step, memoryful AI agent for release by the end of 2025, aiming to rival OpenAI and Anthropic as the industry shifts toward autonomous agents.

1ncsu6k,Learn AI or Get Left Behind: A Review of Dan Hendrycks’ Intro to AI Safety,"**Learn and start using AI, or you'll get eaten by it, or qualified users of it.** And because this technology is so extremely powerful, it's essential to know how it works. There is no ostrich maneuver or wiggle room here. This will be as mandatory as learning to use computer tech in the 80s and 90s. It is on its way to becoming a basic work skill, as fundamental as wielding a pen. In this unforgiving new reality, ignorance is not bliss, it is obsolescence. That is why Dan Hendrycks’ *Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics & Society* is not just another book, it is a survival manual disguised as a scholarly tome.

https://preview.redd.it/hhytxwvjz6of1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ecfa313b7b7735a89bdd74485bf19385438ce3c

Hendrycks, a leading AI safety researcher and director of the Center for AI Safety, delivers a work that is both eloquent and profoundly insightful, standing out in the crowded landscape of AI literature. Unlike many in the “Doomer” camp who peddle existential hyperbole or sensationalist drivel, Hendrycks (a highly motivated and disciplined scholar) opts for a sober, realistic appraisal of advanced AI's risks and, potentially, the antidotes. His book is a beacon of reason amid hysteria, essential for anyone who wants to navigate AI's perils without succumbing to panic or denial. He is a realistic purveyor of coverage of the space. I would call him a decorated member of the Chicken Little Society who is worth a listen. There are some others who deserve the same admiration to be sure, such as Tegmark, LeCun, Paul Christiano.

And then others, not so much. Some of the most extreme existential voices act like they spent their time on the couch smoking pot, reading and absorbing too much sci-fi. All hype, no substance. They took *The Terminator*’s Skynet and *The Forbin Project* too seriously. But they found a way to make a living by imitating Chicken Little to scare the hell out of everyone, for their own benefit.

What elevates this book to must-read status is its dual prowess. It is a deep dive into AI safety and alignment, but also one of the finest primers on the inner workings of generative large language models (LLMs). Hendrycks really knows his stuff and guides you through the mechanics, from neural network architectures to training processes and scaling laws with crystalline clarity, without jargon overload. Whether you are a novice or a tech veteran, it is a start-to-finish educational odyssey that demystifies how LLMs conjure human-like text, tackle reasoning, and sometimes spectacularly fail. This foundational knowledge is not optional, it is the armor you need to wield AI without becoming its casualty.

Hendrycks’ intellectual rigor shines in his dissection of AI's failure modes—misaligned goals, robustness pitfalls, and societal upheavals—all presented with evidence-backed precision that respects the reader’s intellect. No fearmongering, just unflinching analysis grounded in cutting-edge tech.

Yet, perfection eludes even this gem. A jarring pivot into left-wing social doctrine—probing equity in AI rollout and systemic biases—feels like an ideological sideswipe. With Hendrycks’ Bay Area pedigree (PhD from UC Berkeley), it is predictable; academia there often marinates in such views. The game theory twist, applying cooperative models to curb AI-fueled inequalities, is intellectually stimulating but some of the social aspects stray from the book's technical core. It muddies the waters for those laser-focused on safety mechanics over sociopolitical sermons. Still, Generative AI utilizes Game Theory as a vital component within LLM architecture.

If you read it, I recommend that you dissect these elements further, balancing the book's triumphs as a tech primer and safety blueprint against its detours. For now, heed the call: grab this book and arm yourself. If you have tackled *Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics & Society*, how did its tech depth versus societal tangents land for you? Sound off below, let’s spark a debate.

1ncim6k,How would an ad model made for the LLM era look like?,"*(I originally posted it in r/ownyouritent. Reposting ‘cause cross posting not allowed. Curious to know your thoughts)*

AI is breaking the old ad model.

* Keywords are dead: typing “best laptop” once meant links; now AI gives direct answers. Nobody is clicking on links anymore.  
* Early experiments with ads in LLMs aren’t real fixes: Google’s AI Overviews, Perplexity’s sponsored prompts, Microsoft’s ad-voice — all blur the line between answers and ads.  
* Trust is at risk: when the “best” response might just mean “best-paid,” users lose faith.  

So what’s next? One idea: intent-based bidding — where your need is the marketplace, sellers compete transparently to fulfill it, and the “ad” is the offer itself.

We sketched out how this works, and why it could be the structural shift AI commerce actually needs.
