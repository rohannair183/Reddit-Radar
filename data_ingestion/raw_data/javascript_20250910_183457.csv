1nci9sw,"htms-js: Stream Async HTML, Stay SEO-Friendly","Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been playing with web streams lately and ended up building [htms-js](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js), an experimental toolkit for streaming HTML in Node.js.

Instead of rendering the whole HTML at once, it processes it as a stream: tokenize ‚Üí annotate ‚Üí serialize. The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.

There‚Äôs a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.

It‚Äôs very early, so I‚Äôd love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements‚Ä¶ anything goes.

# Packages

This project contains multiple packages:

* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) ‚Äì Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.
* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) ‚Äì Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.
* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) ‚Äì CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.

# üöÄ Quick start

# 1. Install

Use your preferred package manager to install the plugin:

    pnpm add htms-js

# 2. HTML with placeholders

    <!-- home-page.html -->
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang=""en"">
      <body>
        <h1>News feed</h1>
        <div data-htms=""loadNews"">Loading news‚Ä¶</div>
    
        <h1>User profile</h1>
        <div data-htms=""loadProfile"">Loading profile‚Ä¶</div>
      </body>
    </html>

# 3. Async tasks

    // home-page.js
    export async function loadNews() {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));
      return `<ul><li>Breaking story</li><li>Another headline</li></ul>`;
    }
    
    export async function loadProfile() {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 200));
      return `<div class=""profile"">Hello, user!</div>`;
    }

# 4. Stream it (Express)

    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';
    import Express from 'express';
    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';
    
    const app = Express();
    
    app.get('/', async (_req, res) => {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');
      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));
    });
    
    app.listen(3000);

Visit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.

>**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).

# Examples

* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)
* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)
* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git
    cd htms-js
    pnpm i && pnpm build
    
    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start

# How it works

1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.
2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.
3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.
4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.

Result: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead.",javascript,skarab42-dev,5,0.86,3,1757422838.0,https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js,https://reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1nci9sw/htmsjs_stream_async_html_stay_seofriendly/,,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:29:53.335732+00:00

1nch8to,javascript + ai backends: 16 reproducible failure modes (and the fixes you can apply from the client),"ever shipped a clean frontend, got a 200 ok, and the answer still pointed to the wrong doc? most ‚Äúfrontend bugs‚Äù in ai apps are actually backend reasoning failures that are *reproducible* and *fixable* with the right guardrails.

i compiled a Problem Map of 16 failure modes with minimal fixes. it‚Äôs vendor-agnostic, zero-SDK. you can enforce the acceptance contract from your js client and stop the whack-a-mole.

### before vs after (why this works)

* before: patch *after* output. add rerankers, regex, retries, one-off tool calls. the same bug returns somewhere else.

* after: check the semantic state before output. if unstable, loop/reset or refuse. once a mode is mapped, it *stays* fixed.

### quick triage for js devs

* wrong page or random citation ‚Üí No.1 (hallucination & chunk drift) + No.8 (traceability)

* ‚Äúnearest neighbors‚Äù are semantically wrong ‚Üí No.5 (semantic ‚â† embedding)

* long prompts go off the rails mid-chain ‚Üí No.3 (long reasoning chains)

* confident nonsense ‚Üí No.4 (bluffing / overconfidence)

* deploy hits cold indexes / wrong secrets ‚Üí No.14‚Äì16 (bootstrap / deploy deadlocks)

### the acceptance contract (client-side)

target three numbers for every answer:

* ŒîS ‚â§ 0.45  (semantic tension between question and draft answer)

* coverage ‚â• 0.70  (evidence actually supports the claim)

* Œª convergent  (no escalating hazard across steps)

if your backend can emit these, you can hard-gate on the client. minimal sketch:

```

async function ask(q) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/answer', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({q, accept: {deltaS: 0.45, coverage: 0.70}})
  }).then(r => r.json());

  const { text, metrics } = res; // { deltaS, coverage, lambda_state, trace }
  if (metrics.deltaS > 0.45 || metrics.coverage < 0.70 || metrics.lambda_state !== 'convergent') {
    // request a re-grounded attempt or show a transparent fallback
    return { text: 'regrounding‚Ä¶', retry: true, trace: metrics.trace };
  }
  return { text, trace: metrics.trace };
}

```

### trace headers you should insist on

* chunk ids + offsets (so you can jump back to the exact source)

* embedding model + metric (cosine vs dot, normalized?)

* index build id (detect stale or fragmented stores)

* acceptance metrics (ŒîS, coverage, Œª_state)

### when things break, map to a number (then fix it once)

* multi-language answers jump scripts ‚Üí Language / LanguageLocale pages (tokenizer mismatch, analyzer skew)

* hybrid search returns ‚Äúclose but wrong‚Äù ‚Üí RAG_VectorDB: metric mismatch

* html/pdf tables become prose and lose truth values ‚Üí No.11 symbolic collapse

* multi-agent flows wait on each other forever ‚Üí No.13 multi-agent chaos

bookmark this so you don‚Äôt have to remember which knob lives where:

if you try it, reply with the No. you hit and your stack (pgvector/faiss/elasticsearch, langchain/llamaindex/autogen, etc.). i can point you to the exact page for that mode and the smallest viable repair.

1ncfeic,[AskJS] Most frontend frameworks are overkill for 80% of web apps,"Hear me out.. I love React, Vue, Svelte, etc. But the more I build, the more I realise that for most internal tools, dashboards, marketing sites, and CRUD apps.. a basic setup with vanilla JavaScript or even server-rendered HTML (like HTMX or Alpine.js) often gets the job done faster, with less complexity.

Frameworks introduce a lot of overhead:

* Routing, state management, hydration, bundling
* Dev tooling, build pipelines, dependency hell
* Constant updates and breaking changes

For small teams or solo devs, this can be a productivity killer.

I am not saying frameworks are bad, they shine in large-scale apps, SPAs, and highly interactive UIs. But I think we have normalized using them for¬†everything, even when simpler solutions would suffice.

1ncc9zu,"[AskJS] Why isn't it more common to create cross-platform and portable applications and software using web technologies like JS, HTML and CSS ?","I try to get rid of my reliance on proprietary ~~(Microsoft)~~ software with open source projects as much as I can. And regardless of the type of open-source software I'm looking for, I realized I have the following criteria that often come up :

* OS compatibility : with Windows, Linux and MacOS
* Device compatibility : with PC, smartphone and tablet
* Out-of-the-box : No installation required, must be ready for use as is
* Portability : can be used from a USB
* No telemetry and no requirement to be connected to the internet
* Self-contained dependencies to avoid complicated set-ups
* Noob-friendly to download, execute and use by a tech-illiterate grandma

Optional criteria :

* Syncing available across devices
* Easy to change its source code to customize the software / web-app

I realize that pretty much all of these requirements are fulfilled with what would essentially be portable web-apps.

TiddlyWiki is one such example, it's a portable notebook that fits in one single HTML file (but I don't intend to do an implementation that extreme) and it works as intended.

Keep in mind that the alternatives for the type of software I'm looking for are not resource-intensive apps and are often light-weight :

* Notes-taking markdown app (like Obsidian) / or text editor
* E-book and manga reader that supports different file formats (PDF, EPUB, CBZ, etc.) and annotation
* Very simple raster graphics editor like Paint
* File converters
* Meme maker

All of this being said, it cirlces back to my initial question :

Why isn't it more commonplace to use basic web technologies to create open-source projects for light-weight applications ? They seem to offer so much apparent advantages in addition to the fact that every OS and every device has a browser where these ""apps"" can run seamlessly.

Here's what I've done so far: I created a CLI-based user to generate the key and secret key required for configuration. I successfully connected to the Primavera API and obtained the token.

This suggests either:

* WSL‚Äôs virtual network doesn‚Äôt inherit VPN routes,
* Or the Primavera server/firewall only accepts traffic from the Windows IP, not WSL‚Äôs internal IP. Can you confirm whether Primavera is reachable from Linux/WSL, or if it only allows traffic from specific networks or subnets?

1na2gpe,ffetch 2.0 released - Enhanced fetch() wrapper with proper AbortSignal handling,"Just released v2.0 of ffetch, my fetch wrapper that adds timeouts, retries, and circuit breaking without changing fetch semantics.

Major improvements in 2.0:

* Fixed AbortSignal.any fallback that was ignoring user signals
* Manual timeout implementation removes AbortSignal.timeout dependency
* Proper signal composition for complex abort scenarios
* transformRequest hook now preserves signals correctly
* Revamped documentation

The signal handling was surprisingly tricky - combining user AbortSignals with timeout signals while maintaining compatibility across environments. Had to implement manual fallbacks for AbortSignal.any since it's not available everywhere.

Example of the signal composition in action:

    const controller = new AbortController()
    const client = createClient({ timeout: 5000 })
    
    // Both user signal AND timeout signal work together
    client('/api/data', { signal: controller.signal })

Still zero deps, \~2KB, drop-in fetch replacement. The goal was to make fetch() reliable without changing its behavior.

1n8ukb3,Mermaid Editor/Renderer,"Hey,

I write a tech blog and I need to create lots of diagrams for it. I like using Mermaid, but I quickly ran into the same frustrating pattern with most of the existing editors and renderers: the free options were either too limited or came with barriers that slowed me down. I wanted something simple: just open the page, paste/type in Mermaid code, preview the diagram, and export it without worrying about limits or accounts.

Here are some concrete problems I ran into with other tools:

\- Mermaid Live Editor (the official one): Great for quick editing, but exporting diagrams is capped by a rate limit on their free tier. After a handful of exports, I‚Äôd get the dreaded ‚Äúfree tier limit exceeded‚Äù message.

Kroki.io: Supports rendering, but running it online requires trusting a shared service with my diagrams. Hosting it myself means extra setup, Docker, and server resources ‚Äî not ideal if I just want to save a few diagrams.

\- Excalidraw & Lucidchart: Both have nice UIs, but they‚Äôre general diagramming tools, not native Mermaid editors. Lucidchart especially locks useful features (like unlimited diagrams or high-quality export) behind a paid plan.

\- Other browser-based tools Almost all I tried had some kind of paywall, signup requirement, or watermark on exports. For something as text-based and simple as Mermaid, that felt unnecessary.

So I built my own tool with a few core principles:

\- No limits: you can create, edit, and export as many diagrams as you want.

\- No signup: the tool works straight from the browser, nothing to install.

\- No tracking: privacy-friendly, just you and your diagrams.

\- Open source: [https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor](https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor)

1n83l78,"I built USAL.js - a 9KB scroll animation library with text effects and framework support for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular + Web Components","I just released USAL.js - a scroll animation library I built because I was frustrated with existing options for text animations.

# The Problem

I needed word-by-word and letter-by-letter animations for a client project. AOS.js and SAL.js are great, but they don't handle text splitting well, and most libraries don't support web components.

# What I Built

* **9KB minified** (smaller than most images) (5KB Gzipped)
* **40+ animations** (fade, zoom, flip with all directions)
* **Text animations** (split by word/letter, shimmer effects, counters)
* **Framework packages** for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Lit
* **Web Components support** (rare in animation libs)
* **Zero dependencies**

# Quick Examples

**Basic usage:**

    <script src=""https://cdn.usal.dev/latest""></script>
    <div data-usal=""fade-u duration-800"">Fades up smoothly</div>

**Text animations:**

    <p data-usal=""split-word split-fade-r split-delay-200"">
      Each word appears from right
    </p>

**Number counters:**

    <span data-usal=""count-[1234] duration-2000"">1234</span>

**React integration:**

    npm install /react
    
    import { USALProvider } from '@usal/react';
    
    <USALProvider>
      <h1 data-usal=""fade-u"">Animated in React</h1>
    </USALProvider>

# Why Another Animation Library?

* **Tailwind-inspired syntax** (duration-800, delay-200)
* **Text-first approach** (word/letter splitting built-in)
* **True framework agnostic** (even supports Web Components)
* **Performance focused** (60fps with hundreds of elements)

I started with SAL.js as inspiration but ended up rewriting everything from scratch to get the text animations and framework support I wanted.
