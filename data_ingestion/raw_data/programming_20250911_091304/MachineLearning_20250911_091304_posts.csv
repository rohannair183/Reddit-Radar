1ndo5md,[D]NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra crushes MLPerf,"NVIDIA dropped MLPerf results for Blackwell Ultra yesterday. 5× throughput on DeepSeek-R1, record runs on Llama 3.1 and Whisper, plus some clever tricks like FP8 KV-cache and disaggregated serving. The raw numbers are insane.

But I wonder though . If these benchmark wins actually translate into lower real-world inference costs.

In practice, workloads are bursty. GPUs sit idle, batching only helps if you have steady traffic, and orchestration across models is messy. You can have the fastest chip in the world, but if 70% of the time it’s underutilized, the economics don’t look so great to me.

1ndulfv,[D] The best way to structure data for a predictive model of corporate delinquency,"I have annual financial indicators for thousands of clients (businesses), their credit data, and delinquency data, and I want to use this data to create a predictive model.

But what's the best way to structure the data?

* Take the annual financial data and associate it with the following year's delinquency data. So, for example, data from 2024 will predict delinquency in 2025.

OR

* Group by client and calculate the average, maximum, and minimum of the financial data to see if this data can predict delinquency.",MachineLearning,drv29,5,0.86,2,1757549750.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndulfv/d_the_best_way_to_structure_data_for_a_predictive/,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndulfv/d_the_best_way_to_structure_data_for_a_predictive/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-11T13:12:46.817484+00:00,0,,

1ndajmq,[D] Questions on Fairness and Expectations in Top-Tier Conference Submissions,"Hello everyone,

I know that in this community there are many experienced researchers and even reviewers for top-tier conferences. As a young researcher, I sincerely hope to learn from your perspectives and get some clarity on a few concerns I’ve been struggling with.

**My first question:**  
Does a research paper always need to achieve *state-of-the-art (SOTA)* results—outperforming every existing method—to be accepted at an A\* conference? I often feel that so many published papers present dazzling results, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to surpass them.

**My second question, about fairness and accuracy in comparisons:**  
When evaluating a new method, is it acceptable to compare primarily against the most “related,” “similar,” or “same-family” methods rather than the absolute SOTA? For example:

* If I make a small modification to the Bagging procedure in Random Forest, would it be fair to compare only against other Bagging-based forests, rather than something fundamentally different like XGBoost (which is boosting-based)?
* Similarly, if I improve a variant of SVM, is it reasonable to compare mainly with other margin-based or kernel methods, instead of tree-based models like Decision Trees?

I understand that if my method only beats some similar baselines but does not surpass the global best-performing method, reviewers might see it as “meaningless” (since people naturally gravitate toward the top method). Still, I’d like to hear your thoughts: from an experienced researcher’s point of view, what is considered fair and convincing in such comparisons?

Thank you very much in advance for your time and advice.",MachineLearning,Feuilius,5,0.69,6,1757500247.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndajmq/d_questions_on_fairness_and_expectations_in/,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndajmq/d_questions_on_fairness_and_expectations_in/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-11T13:12:59.353294+00:00,4,24.0,8.0
