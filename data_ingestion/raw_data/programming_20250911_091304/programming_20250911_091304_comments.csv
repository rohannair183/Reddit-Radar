ndhbcep,1ndemk4,1ndemk4,grauenwolf,"> More strength reduction. “Strength reduction” is a classic compiler optimization that replaces more expensive operations, like multiplications, with cheaper ones, like additions. In .NET 9, this was used to transform indexed loops that used multiplied offsets (e.g. index * elementSize) into loops that simply incremented a pointer-like offset (e.g. offset += elementSize), cutting down on arithmetic overhead and improving performance. 

This is where the ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"" comes into play. The author of that saying wasn't talking about all optimizations. Rather, he was talking specifically about small optimizations like manually converting multiplication into addition. 

To put it into plain English, it's better to write code that shows the intent of the programmer and let the compiler handle the optimization tricks. It can do it more reliably than you can and, if a better trick is found, switch to that at no cost to you.

Big optimizations, like not making 5 database calls when 1 will do, should still be handled by the programmer.",13,1757524540.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ndemk4/performance_improvements_in_net_10/ndhbcep/,False,0,0,,False,2025-09-11T13:12:20.747249+00:00,programming

With dynamic PGO, the JIT is able to instrument a method’s compilation and then use the resulting profiling data as part of emitting an optimized version of the method. One of the things it can profile are which types are used in a virtual dispatch. If one type dominates, it can special-case that type in the code gen and emit a customized implementation specific to that type. That then enables devirtualization in that dedicated path, which is “guarded” by the relevant type check, hence “GDV”. In some cases, however, such as if a virtual call was being made in a shared generic context, GDV would not kick in. Now it will.

ndhahrv,1ndemk4,1ndemk4,grauenwolf,"> Eliminating some covariance checks. Writing into arrays of reference types can require “covariance checks.” Imagine you have a class Base and two derived types Derived1 : Base and Derived2 : Base. Since arrays in .NET are covariant, I can have a Derived1[] and cast it successfully to a Base[], but under the covers that’s still a Derived1[]. That means, for example, that any attempt to store a Derived2 into that array should fail at runtime, even if it compiles. 

Array covariance was a mistake in Java that .NET copied. 

In some ways it makes sense because .NET was originally meant to run Java code via the J# language. But J# never had a chance because it was based on an outdated version of Java that virtually everyone moved away from before .NET was released.

This is where J++ enters the story. When Sun sued Microsoft over making Java better so it could work with COM (specifically by adding properties and events), part of the agreement was that J++ would be frozen at Java 1.1. Which was a real problem because Java 1.2 brought a lot of enhancements that everyone agreed were necessary. 

Going back to J#, I don't know if it was literally based on J++ or just influenced by it. But either way, it too was limited to Java 1.1 features. Which meant it really had no chance and thus the array covariance wasn't really needed.",5,1757524307.0,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ndemk4/performance_improvements_in_net_10/ndhahrv/,False,0,0,,False,2025-09-11T13:12:20.747280+00:00,programming
