1nddp6e,We messed up our query builder for years. Here's the story of how we fixed it and the lessons we earned along the way.,"I want to share a story from our team at SigNoz. For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.

After 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically ""obvious"" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.

This led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay",programming,ExcitingThought2794,5,0.67,1,1757509579.0,http://signoz.io/blog/query-builder-v5/,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nddp6e/we_messed_up_our_query_builder_for_years_heres/,,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:28:09.933692+00:00

1ndpv4f,A Rant About Multiprocessing,"The simplest system architecture is a single, monolithic process. This is the gold standard of all possible architectures. Why is it a thing worthy of reverence? Because it involves a single programming language and no interprocess communication, i.e. a messaging library. Software development doesn’t get more carefree than life within the safe confines of a single process.

In the age of websites and cloud computing, instances of monolithic implementations are rare. Even an HTTP server presenting queries to a database server is technically two processes and a client library. There are other factors that push system design to multiprocessing, like functional separation, physical distribution and concurrency. So realistically, the typical architecture is a multiprocessing architecture.

What is it about multiprocessing that bumps an architecture off the top of the list of places-I’d-rather-be? At the architectural level, the responsibility for starting and managing processes may be carried by a third-party such as Kubernetes - making it something of a non-issue. No, the real problems with multiprocessing start when the processes start communicating with each other.

Consider that HTTP server paired with a database server. A single call to the HTTP server involves 5 type systems and 4 encoding/decoding operations. That’s kinda crazy. Every item of data - such as a floating-point value - exists at different times in 5 different forms, and very specific code fragments are involved in transformations between runtime variables (e.g. Javascript, Python and C++) and portable representations (e.g. JSON and protobuf).

It’s popular to refer to architectures like these as layered, or as a software stack. If a Javascript application is at the top level of a stack and a database query language is at the lowest level, then all the type capability within the different type systems, must align, i.e. floats, datetimes and user-defined types (e.g. Person) must move up and down the stack without loss of integrity. Basic types such as booleans, integers and strings are fairly well supported (averting the engineers gaze from 32-bit vs 64-bit integers and floats), but support gets rocky with types often referred to as generics, e.g. vectors/lists, arrays and maps/dicts. The chances of a map of Person objects, indexed on a UUID, passing seamlessly from Javascript application to database client library are extremely low. Custom transformations invariably take up residence in your codebase.

Due diligence on your stack involves detailed research, prototyping and unit tests. Edge cases can be nasty, such as when a 64-bit serial id is passed into a type system that only supports 32-bits. Datetime values are particularly fraught. Bugs associated with these cases can surface after months of fault-free operation. The presence of unit tests at all levels drags your development velocity down.

Next up is the style of interaction that a client has with the system, e.g. with the HTTP server. The modern software stack has evolved to handle CRUD-like requests over a database model. This is a blocking, request-response interaction and it has been incredibly effective. It is less effective at delivering services that do not fit this mold. What if your Javascript client wants to open a window that displays a stream of monitoring device events? How does your system propagate operational errors up to the appropriate administrator?

Together, HTTP and Javascript now provide a range of options in this space, such as the Push API, Server-side Events, HTTP/2 Server Push and Websockets, with possibly the latter providing the cleanest basis for universal two-way, asynchronous messaging. Sadly, that still leaves a lot of work to do - what encoding is to be used, what type system is available (e.g. the JSON encoding has no datetime) and how are multiple conversations multiplexed over the single websocket connection? Who or what are the entities engaged in these conversations, because there must be someone or something - right?

The ability to multiplex multiple conversations influences the internal architecture of your processes. Without matching sophistication in the communicating parties, a multi-lane freeway is a high-volume transport to the same old choke points. Does anyone know a good software entity framework?

There are further demands on the capabilities of the messaging facility. Processes such as the HTTP server are a point of access for external processes. Optimal support for a complex, multi-view client would have multiple entry points available providing direct access to the relevant processes. Concerns about security may force the merging of the multiple points into a single point. That point of access would need to make the necessary internal connections and provide the ongoing routing of message streams to their ultimate destinations.

Lastly, the adoption of multiple programming languages not only requires the matching linguistic skills but also breaks the homogeneous nature of your system. Consider a simple bubble diagram where each bubble is a process and each arrow represents a connection from one process to the other. The ability to add arrows anywhere assumes the availability of the same messaging system in every process, and therefore, every language.

Multiprocessing with a multiplexing communications framework can deliver the systems environment that we might subconsciously lust after. But where is that framework and what would it even look like?

Well, the link in the post takes you to the docs for my best attempt.

1ncnrfs,Does the world need another distributed queue?,"I saw a post here recently talking about building a distributed queue. We built our own at Cloudkitchens, it is based on an in-house built sharder and CRDB. It also features a neat solution to head-of-the-line blocking by keeping track of consumption per key, which we call the Keyed Event Queue, or KEQ. Think it is like Kafka, with pretty much unlimited number of partitions. We have been running it in production for mission-critical workloads for almost five years, so it is reasonably battle-proven. 

It makes development of event-driven systems that require a true Active-Active multiregional topology relatively easy, and I can see how it can evolve to be even more reliable and cost efficient. 

We talked internally about open-sourcing it, but as it is coupled with our internal libraries, it will require some work to get done. Do you think anyone outside will benefit/use a system like that?

1nd95t0,Comparing Virtual Threads vs Platform Threads in Spring Boot using JMeter Load Test,"I have created one video lesson on **Spring Boot Virtual Threads vs Platform Threads Performance with JMeter Load Testing .**

**Link:** [https://youtu.be/LDgriPNWCjY](https://youtu.be/LDgriPNWCjY)

Here  I checked how **Virtual Threads** actually perform compared to **Platform Threads** in a real Spring Boot app in case of **IO Based Operations** .  
For the setup , I ran **two instances of the same application**:

* First one - with Virtual Threads enabled
* Second one - Same application with the default Tomcat thread pool (Platform Threads) running on different port 

Then I used **JMeter** to hit both application with increasing load (starting around 200 users/sec, then pushing up to 1000+). I have also captured the side-by-side results ( like the graphs, throughput, response times) .

**Observations:**

* With **Platform Threads**, once Tomcat hit its  around 200 thread pool limit, response times started getting worse gradually 
* With **Virtual Threads**, the application  did scale pretty well - throughput was much higher and the average response timesremained low.
* The difference became more more distinct when I was running longer tests with heavier load.
* **One caveat:** this benefit really shows up with **I/O-heavy requests** (I even added a `Thread.sleep` to simulate work).

The compromises all stem from a core developers NPM account getting taken over from a phishing campaign

The malware itself, luckily, looks like its mostly intrested in crypto at the moment so its impact is smaller than if they had installed a backdoor for example.

# How the Malware Works (Step by Step)

1. **Injects itself into the browser**
   * Hooks core functions like `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and wallet APIs (`window.ethereum`, Solana, etc.).
   * Ensures it can intercept both web traffic and wallet activity.
2. **Watches for sensitive data**
   * Scans network responses and transaction payloads for anything that looks like a wallet address or transfer.
   * Recognizes multiple formats across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.
3. **Rewrites the targets**
   * Replaces the legitimate destination with an attacker-controlled address.
   * Uses “lookalike” addresses (via string-matching) to make swaps less obvious.
4. **Hijacks transactions before they’re signed**
   * Alters Ethereum and Solana transaction parameters (e.g., recipients, approvals, allowances).
   * Even if the UI looks correct, the signed transaction routes funds to the attacker.
5. **Stays stealthy**
   * If a crypto wallet is detected, it avoids obvious swaps in the UI to reduce suspicion.
   * Keeps silent hooks running in the background to capture and alter real transactions

1ndmzzf,Is this the end of hand-written Java? Building an app with AI-generated code (OpenXava + Vibe Coding),"I'm creating a YouTube course where I build a complete car insurance policy management application in Java. The twist: I'm **not writing the Java code directly**. Instead, I'm using a combination of tools:

1.  **OpenXava:** A framework that auto-generates a full UI from JPA entities (using annotations for behavior).
2.  **Vibe Coding (AI):** I use an LLM to generate the necessary Java entity code through natural language prompts. I describe the class, its fields, and logic, and the AI writes the code for me.

The entire process focuses on high-level design and refining the auto-generated results, not on writing code line by line.

I just published the third lesson, which focuses on refining the UI that OpenXava generates from the AI-written entities:

**I'm curious to get this community's opinion on this workflow:**

*   What is your take on using LLMs (like Vibe Coding) to generate boilerplate or even complex entity code instead of writing it manually?
*   Does the combination of AI-generated code + a framework that auto-generates the UI represent a viable future for enterprise application development?
*   **Does this mean the end of writing Java code directly?** Or is hand-written code simply moving to a higher level of abstraction, remaining essential for complex logic, integrations, and customization?

1ncl9ws,Engineering a High-Performance Go PDF Microservice,"I built **GoPdfSuit**, an open-source web service for generating PDFs, and wanted to share the technical design that makes it exceptionally fast and efficient. My goal was to create a lean alternative to traditional, resource-heavy PDF solutions.

# Core Technical Design

The core of the service is built on **Go 1.23+** and the **Gin framework** for their high performance and concurrency capabilities. Unlike many other services that rely on disk-based processing, GoPdfSuit is a **high-performance in-memory PDF generator**. This approach is crucial to its speed, as it completely bypasses slow disk I/O operations, leading to ultra-fast response times of sub-millisecond to low-millisecond.

For the actual HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-image conversions, the service leverages the power of `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage`. This allows it to accurately render web pages and HTML snippets into high-quality PDFs and images. The project demonstrates how intelligently integrating and managing a powerful external tool like `wkhtmltopdf` can lead to a highly optimized and performant solution.

# Key Features and Implementation Details

* **Template-Driven System**: GoPdfSuit utilizes a **JSON-driven templating system**. This design separates data from presentation, making it simple to generate complex, dynamic PDFs by just sending a JSON payload to the REST API.
* **Flexible PDF Generation**: The service supports multi-page documents with automatic page breaks and custom page sizes, giving developers a high degree of control over the output. It also includes support for **AcroForm** and **XFDF data**, enabling the filling out of interactive forms programmatically.
* **Deployment**: It's deployed as a single, statically compiled binary, making it extremely easy to get up and running in any environment, from a local machine to a containerized cloud deployment.

I'm happy to discuss the implementation details, the challenges of orchestrating `wkhtmltopdf` in a high-concurrency environment, or the design of the in-memory processing pipeline.

1ncyhoc,I tried adding a 3D game inside my social media app (React + Three.js),"Most social media apps look and feel the same — feeds, likes, and endless scrolling.
So I thought: what if I added a 3D game directly inside the app I’m building?

	•	Half-finished real-time notifications 🚧
	•	→ To experimenting with Three.js + React wrappers 🎮
	•	→ To getting a simple 3D character walking around inside my app 👾

I even tried (and failed gloriously) to make it multiplayer with WebSockets — imagine Instagram mixed with Roblox. Chaos, but fun chaos.

1ndj5vz,"I decoupled FastAPI dependency injection system in pure python, no dependencies.","**What My Project Does**

When building FastAPI endpoints, I found the dependency injection system such a pleasure to use that I wanted it everywhere, not just in my endpoints. I explored a few libraries that promised similar functionality, but each had drawbacks, some required Pydantic, others bundled in features beyond dependency injection, and many were riddled with bugs.

That's way I created [PyDepends](https://github.com/entropy-flux/PyDepends), a lightweight dependency injection system that I now use in my own projects and would like to share with you.

**Target Audience**  
This is mainly aimed at:

* FastAPI developers who want to use dependency injection in the service layer.

* Domain-Driven Design practitioners who want to decouple their services from infrastructure.

* Python developers who aren’t building API endpoints but would still like to use dependency injection in their projects.
It’s not production-grade yet, but it’s stable enough for everyday use and easy to extend.

**Comparison**  

Compared to other similar packages, it does just that, inject dependencies, is not bloated with other functionalities. 

* FastDepends: I started out with this for another library I was using but had to ditch it because of the bugs. I even opened a pull request fixing the issue, but it wasn’t taken into account. It also cannot be used with non-serializable classes, and I wanted to inject machine learning models into services. On top of that, it does unpredictable things beyond dependency injection.

1ndm9zl,"Update: Python-based MTG Commander Deck Builder — Now With Combos, Bracket Enforcement, and Include/","Hi r/Python, I wanted to share another update on my Python-based project: a **Magic: The Gathering Commander deck builder**. My first post here was when I had a mostly command-line tool; then I moved to a basic web interface. Since then I’ve added quite a few new features, cleaned up the backend, and expanded both the web and CLI sides.

# What My Project Does

* Pick a commander and up to three themes (e.g., Aristocrats, +1/+1, Kindred, Aggro).
* The builder generates a complete 100-card list with stage-by-stage reasoning.
* Handles multi-copy strategies (Petitioners, Dragon’s Approach, Shadowborn Apostle) with packages that keep the deck at 100 and adjust land counts automatically.
* Lets you lock favorite cards, reroll just creatures/spells/lands, or swap cards for alternatives.
* Supports “owned-only” and “prefer owned” builds by uploading TXT/CSV lists of your collection.
* Exports to TXT (Moxfield/Archidekt), CSV with tags/Owned info, or a simple printout.

# Target Audience

* **Magic: The Gathering players** who like to theorycraft and spin up decks quickly.
* People who want to give a few high-level instructions (commander, themes, composition) and get a playable decklist back.
* Developers or hobbyists interested in Python projects that mix data handling, web UI, and CLI tooling.

# Comparison

I built this because I wasn’t finding much in the way of Python-based, “hands-off” deck builders. Tools like EDHRec, Moxfield, and Archidekt are great, but they generally need a lot of manual input. My approach is closer to: “give me a commander and some themes, generate a deck, and let me iterate fast.” It also lets me compare multiple builds for the same commander or themes to see how choices shift.

# What’s New

* **Combos & Synergies:** detects curated two-card combos, surfaces them in the web UI with badges, and honors color identity.
* **Bracket Compliance:** validates decks against configurable bracket rules (like tutors/extra turns); includes inline enforcement and optional auto-fixing.
* **Include/Exclude Lists:** add must-have or must-exclude cards via text/file input; supports fuzzy matching, EDH color checks, and JSON import/export.
* **Web UI Polish:** improved New Deck modal, integrated multi-copy suggestions, cleaner alternatives panel, and mobile-friendly layouts.
* **CLI Parity:** theme selection by name, deck composition flags (`--land-count`, `--wipe-count`, etc.), and full include/exclude support with detailed console summaries.
* **Performance & Stability:** exclude filtering benchmarked under 50ms on 20k+ cards; Docker image seeds defaults automatically; fixes for land counts, exports mismatches, and mobile scaling quirks.

# Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.x with structured logging, modular orchestration, and test suite for validation and backward compatibility.
* **Web:** Flask + Jinja templates, partial caching, validation endpoints, and Playwright end-to-end tests.
* **CLI:** argparse interface with type indicators, grouped help, and full parity with web features.
* **Deployment:** Docker with multi-arch builds (x86/ARM), sample docker-compose configs.

# Try it

* Live demo: [deck-builder.wiz-ops.com](https://deck-builder.wiz-ops.com/) (setup may take a minute).
* Docker Hub (easiest): [mwisnowski/mtg-python-deckbuilder](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwisnowski/mtg-python-deckbuilder)
* Source & releases: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mwisnowski/mtg_python_deckbuilder)

# Roadmap

* Budget mode with price caps and recommended pickup lists.
* Smarter land base profiles tuned by curve and pip breakdown.
* Random build modes (“surprise me,” random by theme, or full random).

This is my first real “from-scratch” software project, so if you have thoughts on the Python side — code structure, testing, deployment — I’d love to hear them.

Do you want me to keep this **balanced between MTG features and technical notes**, or make it **more developer-focused** (leaning heavier on Python design decisions, logging, testing, etc.) since it’s for r/Python?",Python,styrofoamshotgun,3,1.0,0,1757528911.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndm9zl/update_pythonbased_mtg_commander_deck_builder_now/,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndm9zl/update_pythonbased_mtg_commander_deck_builder_now/,Showcase,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:28:58.153069+00:00

I have given hints to my manager that I have some coding knowledge and given them snippets of the tool I’ve created, she’s pretty much given me free reign to stop any of my usual tasks and focus on this full time. My partner used to work for the same company in the finance department so I know they paid over £200k for 3 people to develop the current workflow tool (these developers had no operations experience so built something unfit for purpose). I’ve estimated if I can get my app functional it would save the company £20k per month (due to all the manual work we usually have to do vs what I can automate). My manager has already said this puts me in a good position for a decent bonus next year (it wouldn’t be anymore than £10k) so I’m a little stuck on what to do and if I’m sounding greedy. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar position? 

EDIT TITLE: I know it’s not ‘for free’ as of course I’m paid to do my job. But I would be handing over hours of work that I haven’t been paid for.

1ndgpwv,Curious about moving from Mechanical Engineering to Data Science," Hey everyone,

I’m wrapping up my final year in **Mechanical Engineering**, and lately I’ve been fascinated by how data is shaping decisions in engineering, manufacturing, and beyond. The more I read about **data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling**, the more I feel drawn to explore this path.

My background is heavy on problem-solving, math, and physics, and I’ve done some basic coding in Python and MATLAB for academic projects. I’m now experimenting with SQL and data visualization tools, and I’m considering building small projects that combine engineering concepts with data insights.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve made a similar shift:

* What was the most valuable skill or habit you developed early on?
* Did you start in a data-related role within your original industry, or switch fields entirely?
* Any project ideas that helped you stand out when you were starting out?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!",Python,osm_22,4,1.0,8,1757516750.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndgpwv/curious_about_moving_from_mechanical_engineering/,https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ndgpwv/curious_about_moving_from_mechanical_engineering/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:29:00.162246+00:00
1nds31l,[ANNOUNCEMENT] pychub: A new way to ship your Python wheels + deps + extras,"Hey fellow deveopers!  
  
I built a packaging tool called [**pychub**](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub) that might fill a weird little gap you didn’t know you had. It came out of me needing a clean way to distribute Python wheels *with* all of their dependencies and optional extras, but *without* having to freeze them into platform-specific binaries like PyInstaller does. And if you want to just install everything into your own current environment?  That's what I wanted, too.

# So what is it?

**pychub** takes your wheel, resolves and downloads its dependencies, and wraps everything into a single executable `.chub` file. That file can then be shipped/copied anywhere, and then run directly like this:

    python yourtool.chub

It installs into the current environment (or a venv, or a conda env, your call), and can even run an entrypoint function or console script *right after* install.

No network calls. No pip. No virtualenv setup. Just `python tool.chub` and go.

# Why I built it:

Most of the Python packaging tools out there either:

* Freeze the whole thing into a binary (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer) — which is great, until you hit platform issues or need to debug something. Or you just want to do something different than that.
* Just stop at building a wheel and leave it up to you (or your users) to figure out installation, dependencies, and environment prep.

I wanted something in between: still using the host Python interpreter (so it stays light and portable), but with everything pre-downloaded and reproducible.

# What it can bundle:

* Your main wheel
* Any number of additional wheels
* All their dependencies (downloaded and stored locally)
* Optional include files (configs, docs, whatever)
* Pre-install and post-install scripts (shell, Python, etc.)

And it’s 100% reproducible, so that the archive installs the exact same versions every time, no network access needed.

# Build tool integration:

If you're using **Poetry**, **Hatch**, or **PDM**, I’ve released plugins for all three:

* Just add the plugin to your `pyproject.toml`
* Specify your build details (main wheel, includes, scripts, etc.)
* Run your normal build command and you’ll get a `.chub` alongside your `.whl`

It’s one of the easiest ways to ship Python tools that *just work,* whether you're distributing internally, packaging for air-gapped environments, or dropping into Docker builder stages.

Plugins repo:  [https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub-build-plugins)

# Why not just use some other bundling/packaging tool?

Well, depending on your needs, maybe you should! I don’t think pychub replaces everything. It just solves a different problem.

If you want sealed apps with bundled runtimes, use PEX or PyOxidizer.  
If you're distributing scripts, zipapp is great.  
But if you want a **wheel-based**, network-free, single-file installer that works on any Python 3.9+ environment, then pychub might be the right tool.

Full comparison table along with everything else:  
📘 [README on GitHub](https://github.com/Steve973/pychub#why-not-just-use-insert-favorite-tool-name-here)

That’s it. I built it because I needed it to include plugins for a platform that I am building. If it helps you too, even better.  I will be actively supporting this, and if you would like to take it for a spin and see if you like it, I'd be honored to hear your feedback. If you want a feature added, etc, please let me know.  
Issues, suggestions, and PRs are all welcome.

Thanks for your time and interest!

1nd1go9,I created a pretty-printed dir function to make debugging complex classes easier,"**What My Project Does**

You can check it out on github: [https://pypi.org/project/pretty-dir/](https://pypi.org/project/pretty-dir/)

This library generates a better **dir** output for debugging. For a quick example, check out the [with dir](https://github.com/douglassimonsen/ppdir/raw/main/example_images/before.png) and [with ppdir](https://github.com/douglassimonsen/ppdir/raw/main/example_images/after.png) outputs using a simple pydantic model.

  
**Target Audience**

This is mainly aimed at developers who are debugging code that uses any libraries that have large, complex, deeply nested classes. Libraries such as pydantic, dataclasses, and openpyxl.

**Comparison**

It exists in a similar niche as icecream and rich.inspect where it's meant to improve the debugging experience. Unlike similar libraries, this only shows the structure, not the values themselves. This is valuable in pydantic environments, where instances can be too verbose to be meaningful when printed to the console.

**Details**

The library uses the output of the **dir(obj)** function as a baseline, but improves the output in a number of ways:

* Visually groups the methods and attributes by the classes they were defined on. Therefore, if you're subclassing the [pydantic.BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) class, it separates the generic basemodel methods from the subclass' specific methods.
* Pulls the first line of the docstrings for the class, all methods, and all class attributes.
* Can enable showing the function signature for all class methods
* By default, hides private and and dunder methods from the outputs
* Prints the source code location of all parent classes
* Uses [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) to color the different sections of the output

I've set it to automatically import (see **Auto-loading in PDB (Breakpoint)** on PyPI) when I use breakpoint() and it's been a nice quality of life improvement!

1ncy8av,Most Performant Python Compilers/Transpilers in 2025,"Today I find myself in the unfortunate position to create a program that must compile arbitrary python code :(  For the use case I am facing now performance is everything, and luckily the target OS for the executable file will only be linux. The compiled codes will be standalone local computational tools without any frills (no guis, no i|o or r|w operations, no system access, and no backend or configuration needs to pull in). Python code is >=3.8 and can pull in external libraries (eg: numpy). However, the codes may be multithreaded/multiprocessed and any static type-like behavior is not guaranteed.

Historically I have used tools like pyinstaller, py2exe, py2app, which work robustly, but create stand alone executable files that are often pretty slow. I have been looking at a host of transpilers instead, eg: [https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/dbohdan/compilers-targeting-c?tab=readme-ov-file), and am somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of choices therein. Going through stackoverflow naturally recovered a lot of great recommendations that were go-to's 10-20 years ago, but do not have much promise for recent python versions. Currently I am considering:  
wax [https://github.com/LingDong-/wax](https://github.com/LingDong-/wax) ,  
11l-lang [https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/](https://11l-lang.org/transpiler/),

rpython [https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),  
or py14  https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/py14.  
However, this is a lot to consider without rigorously testing all of them out. Does anyone on this sub have experience in modern Transpilers or other techniques for compiling numerical python codes for linux? If so, can you share any tools, techniques, or general guidance? Thank you!

Edit for clarification:  
This will be placed in a user facing application wherein users can upload their tools to be autonomously deployed in a on demand/dynamic runtime basis.

1ndhycj,AI-Rulez v2.0: Universal AI Assistant Configuration Management,"I'm happy to showcase AI-Rulez v2, which is a major next step in the development of this tool. 

**The Problem:** If you're using multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot), you've probably noticed the configuration fragmentation. Each tool demands its own format - `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone.

**The Solution:** AI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. It's like having a build system for AI context.

## Why This Matters for Development Teams

Teams using AI assistants face common challenges:
- **Multiple tools, multiple configs**: Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions
- **Framework-specific standards**: Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management (uv, poetry, npm, etc.)  
- **Monorepo complexity**: Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts
- **Team consistency**: Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors

AI-Rulez solves this with a single `ai-rulez.yaml` that understands your project's conventions.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Project Analysis
The `init` command is where AI-Rulez shines. Instead of manually writing configurations, let AI analyze your codebase:

```bash
# AI analyzes your codebase and generates tailored config
uvx ai-rulez init ""My Project"" --preset popular --use-agent claude --yes
```

This automatically:
- Detects your tech stack (Python/Node/Go, testing frameworks, linters)
- Identifies project patterns and conventions
- Generates appropriate coding standards and practices
- Creates specialized agents for different tasks (code review, testing, docs)
- **Automatically adds all generated AI files to .gitignore** - no more committing `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md` by accident

### Universal Output Generation
One YAML config generates files for every tool:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
metadata:
  name: ""Python API Service""

presets:
  - ""popular""  # Auto-configures Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot

rules:
  - name: ""Python Type Safety""
    priority: critical
    content: |
      - Python 3.11+ with complete type annotations
      - Use | for unions: str | None not Optional[str]
      - mypy strict mode required
      - Type all function signatures and returns

  - name: ""Testing Standards""
    priority: high
    content: |
      - pytest with async support and fixtures
      - 100% coverage for new code
      - Use factory_boy for test data
      - Integration tests with real PostgreSQL

agents:
  - name: ""python-reviewer""
    description: ""Python code review specialist""
    system_prompt: ""Focus on type safety, performance, and Pythonic patterns""
```

Run `uvx ai-rulez generate` and get:
- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` for Cursor
- `.windsurfrules` for Windsurf  
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot
- Custom formats for any future AI tool

### Advanced Features

**MCP Server Integration**: Direct integration with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools:
```bash
# Start built-in MCP server with 19 configuration management tools
uvx ai-rulez mcp
```

**Comprehensive CLI**: Manage configs without editing YAML:
```bash
# Add Python-specific rules on the fly
uvx ai-rulez add rule ""FastAPI Standards"" --priority high --content ""Use Pydantic v2 models with Field validation""

# Create specialized agents
uvx ai-rulez add agent ""pytest-expert"" --description ""Testing specialist for Python projects""
```

**Team Collaboration**: 
- Remote config includes: `includes: [""https://github.com/myorg/python-standards.yaml""]`
- Local overrides: Personal customization via `.local.yaml` files
- Monorepo support: `--recursive` flag handles complex Python projects

### Enterprise Features

**Security & Compliance**:
- SSRF protection for remote config includes
- Schema validation prevents configuration errors
- Audit trails for configuration changes

**Performance**:
- Written in Go - instant startup even for large Python monorepos
- Concurrent generation for multiple output files
- Smart caching for remote configurations

## Target Audience

- **Python developers** using multiple AI coding assistants
- **Python teams** needing consistent AI behavior across projects  
- **DevOps engineers** managing AI configurations in CI/CD pipelines
- **Open source maintainers** wanting AI-ready Python project documentation
- **Enterprise teams** requiring centralized AI assistant management

## Comparison to Alternatives

### vs Manual Configuration Management
**Manual approach**: Maintain separate `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurfrules` files
- Problem: Configuration drift, inconsistent standards, manual syncing
- **AI-Rulez solution**: Single source generates all formats automatically

### vs Basic Tools (airules, template-ai)
**Basic tools**: Simple file copying or template systems
- **AI-Rulez advantages**: 
  - AI-powered codebase analysis and config generation
  - MCP protocol integration for live configuration management
  - Full CRUD CLI for configuration management
  - Enterprise security features and team collaboration

### vs Tool-Specific Solutions
**Tool-specific**: Each AI assistant has its own configuration system
- **AI-Rulez advantages**:
  - Future-proof: works with new AI tools without reconfiguration
  - Repository-level management for complex Python projects
  - Consistent behavior across your entire AI toolchain

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install ai-rulez

# Or run without installing
uvx ai-rulez init ""My Python Project"" --preset popular --yes

# Generate configuration files
ai-rulez generate

# Add to your pre-commit hooks
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez
    rev: v2.1.3
    hooks:
      - id: ai-rulez-validate
      - id: ai-rulez-generate
```

## Real-World Example

Here's how a Django + React monorepo benefits from AI-Rulez:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
extends: ""https://github.com/myorg/python-base.yaml""

sections:
  - name: ""Architecture""
    content: |
      - Django REST API backend with PostgreSQL
      - React TypeScript frontend
      - Celery for async tasks
      - Docker containerization

agents:
  - name: ""django-expert""
    system_prompt: ""Django specialist focusing on DRF, ORM optimization, and security""
  
  - name: ""frontend-reviewer""  
    system_prompt: ""React/TypeScript expert for component architecture and testing""

mcp_servers:
  - name: ""database-tools""
    command: ""uvx""
    args: [""mcp-server-postgres""]
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ""postgresql://localhost/myproject""
```

This generates tailored configurations for each AI tool, ensuring consistent guidance whether you're working on Django models or React components.

AI-Rulez has evolved significantly since v1.0, adding AI-powered initialization, comprehensive MCP integration, and enterprise-grade features. It's being used by teams managing large Python codebases who need consistent AI assistant behavior across their entire development workflow.

I've personally seen this solve major headaches in production Python projects where different team members were getting inconsistent AI guidance. The `init` command with AI analysis is particularly powerful for getting started quickly.

1nckydw,Cythonize Python Code,"# Context

This is my first time messing with **Cython** (or really anything related to optimizing Python code).  
I usually just stick with yielding and avoiding keeping much in memory, so bear with me.

# Context

I’m building a Python project that’s kind of like `zipgrep` / `ugrep`.  
It streams through archive(s) file contents (nothing kept in memory) and searches for whatever pattern is passed in.

# Benchmarks

(Results vary depending on the pattern, hence the wide gap)

* ✅ **\~15–30x faster** than `zipgrep` (expected)
* ❌ **\~2–8x slower** than `ugrep` (also expected, since it’s C++ and much faster)

I tried:

* `cythonize` from [`Cython.Build`](http://Cython.Build) with setuptools
* Nuitka

But the performance was basically identical in both cases. I didn’t see any difference at all.  
Maybe I compiled Cython/Nuitka incorrectly, even though they both built successfully?

# Question

Is it actually worth:

* Manually writing `.c` files
* Switching the right parts over to `cdef`

Or is this just one of those cases where Python’s overhead will always keep it behind something like `ugrep`?

1ncn5fq,imgbatch – A Python tool for batch-processing images from the command line,"**What My Project Does**

[https://github.com/booo2233/imgbatch](https://github.com/booo2233/imgbatch)

 is a simple Python tool that lets you batch-process images (resize, compress, or convert formats) directly from the command line. Instead of opening heavy software, you can point it at a folder and quickly process all your images in one go.

**Target Audience**  
This is mainly aimed at:

* Developers who need quick image preprocessing for projects
* Photographers or designers who want to resize/compress many images at once
* Anyone who prefers lightweight CLI tools instead of GUIs

It’s not production-grade yet, but it’s stable enough for everyday use and easy to extend.

**Comparison**  
Compared to tools like ImageMagick or Pillow scripts:

* imgbatch is **simpler** (minimal commands, no need to learn a big toolset)
* It’s **focused only on batch tasks** (not a general-purpose graphics library)
* Written in Python, so easy to tweak or add custom functions if you know a little code

Python is great for a lot of things. Just stop abusing it by building (or trying to) UI with it. 

Even if you ship something you'll wake up in mid of night thinking of all the weird scenarios, convincing yourself to go back to sleep since you'll find a workaround like last time. 

Why I am saying this: Because I've tried it all. I've tried every possible way to avoid JavaScript and keep building UIs with Python.

I've contributed to some really popular UI libraries in Python, tried inventing one back in Tkinter days. 

I finally caved in and I now build UI with JavaScript, and I'm happier person now.

1ncgwas,[Project] /dev/push - An open source Vercel for Python apps,"**What My Project Does**

[/dev/push](https://github.com/hunvreus/devpush) is an open source deployment platform that lets you deploy Python apps with a UX similar to Vercel/Render. It handles git-based deployments, environment variables, real-time logs, custom domains...

**Target Audience**

Python developers who want an easier way to self-host and deploy apps. It’s ready for use (I run it for my own apps) but still in beta. Bug reports and feedback is welcome.

**Comparison**

Unlike Vercel or Render, /dev/push is fully open source and self-hosted. You can install and run it on your own Debian/Ubuntu server with a single command, without relying on a third-party platform. Compared to Coolify or CapRover, it’s lighter and more focused on delivering a polished UX.

**How to get started**

You can install it on a any Debian/Ubuntu server with a single command:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunvreus/devpush/main/scripts/prod/install.sh | sudo bash

1nbkguo,I built a programming language interpreted in Python!,"Hey!

I'd like to share a project I've been working on: A functional programming language that I built entirely in Python.

I'm primarily a Python developer, but I wanted to understand functional programming concepts better. Instead of just reading about them, I decided to build my own FP language from scratch. It started as a tiny DSL (domain specific language) for a specific problem (which it turned out to be terrible for!), but I enjoyed the core ideas enough to expand it into a full functional language.

## What My Project Does

NumFu is a pure functional programming language interpreted in Python featuring:
- **Arbitrary precision arithmetic** using `mpmath` - no floating point issues
- **Automatic partial application** and function composition 
- **Built-in testing syntax** with readable assertions
- **Tail call optimization** for efficient recursion
- **Clean syntax** with only four types (Number, Boolean, List, String)

Here's a taste of the syntax:

```numfu
// Functions automatically partially apply
>>> {a, b, c -> a + b + c}(_, 5)
{a, c -> a+5+c}  // Even prints as readable syntax!

// Composition and pipes
let add1 = {x -> x + 1},
    double = {x -> x * 2}
in 5 |> (add1 >> double) // 12

// Built-in testing
let square = {x -> x * x} in
square(7) ---> $ == 49  // ✓ passes
```

## Target Audience

This is **not** a production language - it's 2-5x slower than Python due to double interpretation. It's more of a learning tool for:
- Teaching functional programming concepts without complex syntax
- Sketching mathematical algorithms where precision matters more than speed
- Understanding how interpreters work

## Comparison

NumFu has much simpler syntax than traditional functional languages like Haskell or ML and no complex type system - just four basic types. It's less powerful but much more approachable. I designed it to make FP concepts accessible without getting bogged down in advanced language features. Think of it as functional programming with training wheels.

## Implementation Details

The implementation is about 3,500 lines of Python using:
- *Lark* for parsing
- *Tree-walking interpreter* - straightforward recursive evaluation  
- *mpmath* for arbitrary precision arithmetic


## Try It Out

```bash
pip install numfu-lang
numfu repl
```

## Links

I actually enjoy web design, so NumFu has a (probably overly fancy) landing page + documentation site. 😅

- Website: https://rphle.github.io/numfu/
- Documentation: https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/numfu-lang/

I built this as a learning exercise and it's been fun to work on. Happy to answer questions about design choices or implementation details! I also really appreciate issues and pull requests!

1ncdmvb,cosine=0.91 but answer is wrong. a tiny python MRE for “semantic ≠ embedding” and before/after fix,"What My Project Does

WFGY Problem Map 1.0 is a reasoning-layer “semantic firewall” for python AI pipelines. it defines 16 reproducible failure modes and gives exact fixes without changing infra. for r/Python this post focuses on No.5 semantic ≠ embedding and No.8 retrieval traceability. the point is to show a minimal numpy repro where cosine looks high but the answer is wrong, then apply the before/after firewall idea to make it stick.

---

Target Audience

python folks who ship RAG or search in production. users of faiss, chroma, qdrant, pgvector, or a homegrown numpy knn. if you have logs where neighbors look close but citations point to the wrong section, this is for you.

---

Comparison

most stacks fix errors after generation by adding rerankers or regex. the same failure returns later. the WFGY approach checks the semantic field before generation. if the state is unstable, loop or reset. only a stable state can emit output.

acceptance targets: ΔS(question, context) ≤ 0.45, coverage ≥ 0.70, λ convergent. once these hold, that class of bug stays fixed.

---

Minimal Repro (numpy only)

```

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)
dim = 8

# clean anchors for two topics

A = np.array([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.], dtype=np.float32)
B = np.array([0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.], dtype=np.float32)

# chunks: B cluster is tight, A is sloppy, which fools raw inner product

chunks = np.stack([
    A + 0.20*np.random.randn(dim),
    A + 0.22*np.random.randn(dim),
    B + 0.05*np.random.randn(dim),
    B + 0.05*np.random.randn(dim),
]).astype(np.float32)

def ip_search(q, X, k=2):
    scores = X @ q
    idx = np.argsort(-scores)[:k]
    return idx, scores[idx]

def l2norm(X):
    n = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, keepdims=True) + 1e-12
    return X / n

q = (A + 0.10*np.random.randn(dim)).astype(np.float32)  # should match topic A

# BEFORE: raw inner product, no normalization

top_raw, s_raw = ip_search(q, chunks, k=2)
print(""BEFORE idx:"", top_raw, ""scores:"", np.round(s_raw, 4))

# AFTER: enforce cosine by normalizing both sides

top_cos, s_cos = ip_search(q/np.linalg.norm(q), l2norm(chunks), k=2)
print(""AFTER idx:"", top_cos, ""scores:"", np.round(s_cos, 4))

```

---

on many runs the raw version ranks the tight B cluster above A even though the query is A. enforcing a cosine contract flips it back.

---

Before vs After Fix (what to ship)

1. enforce L2 normalization for both stored vectors and queries when you mean cosine.

2. add a chunk id contract that keeps page or section fields. avoid tiny fragments, normalize casing and width.

3. apply an acceptance gate before you generate. if ΔS or coverage fail, re-retrieve or reset instead of emitting.

# What My Project Does

* Runs sequential, in-process pipelines (not a DAG/orchestrator).
* Shares a typed, Pydantic PipelineContext across steps (assignment-time validation if you want it).
* Skips work via fingerprint caching (fingerprint\_keys).
* Gives simple control signals: ctx.abort\_pass() (retry current pass) and ctx.abort\_pipeline() (stop).
* Lets you compose steps: Step(""name"", children=\[...\]).

# Target Audience

* Data scientists / lab scientists who use notebooks or small scripts and want a shared context across steps.
* Anyone maintaining “glue” scripts that could use caching and simple retry/abort semantics.
* Bio-analytical analysis: load plate → calibrate → QC → report (ie. this project's origin story).
* Data engineers with one-box batch jobs (CSV → clean → export) who don’t want a scheduler and metadata DB (a bit of a stretch, I know).

# Comparison

* Airflow/Dagster/Prefect: Full DAG/orchestrators with schedulers, UIs, state, lineage, retries, SLAs/backfills. lilpipe is intentionally not that. It’s for linear, in-process pipelines where that stack is overkill.
* scikit-learn Pipeline: ML-specific fit/transform/predict on estimators. lilpipe is general purpose steps with a Pydantic context.
* Other lightweight pipeline libraries: don't have the exact features that I use on a day-to-day basis. lilpipe does have those features haha.

1nb8bdn,My Python library to create images from simple layouts,"Hey r/Python,

I'm working on an open-source library for creating images from code. The idea is to build visuals by describing them as simple layouts, instead of calculating `(x, y)` coordinates for everything.

For example, I used it to generate this fake Reddit post card:

[Resulting Image](https://i.imgur.com/JUFXMzK.png)

This whole image was created with the Python code below. It handles all the layout, font fallbacks, text wrapping, and rendering for you.

```python
from pictex import *

# --- 1. Define the small components ---
upvote_icon = Image(""upvote.png"")
downvote_icon = Image(""downvote.png"")
comment_icon = Image(""comment.png"").resize(0.7)
python_icon = Image(""python_logo.png"").size(25, 25).border_radius('50%')

flair = Text(""Showcase"").font_size(12).padding(2, 6).background_color(""#0079D3"").color(""white"").border_radius(10)

# --- 2. Build the layout by composing components ---
vote_section = Column(
    upvote_icon,
    Text(""51"").font_size(40).font_weight(700),
    downvote_icon
).horizontal_align('center').gap(5)

post_header = Row(
    python_icon,
    Text(""r/Python • Posted by u/_unknownProtocol"").font_size(14),
    flair
).gap(8).vertical_align('center')

post_title = Text(
    ""My Python library to create images from simple layouts""
).font_size(22).font_weight(700).line_height(1.2)

post_footer = Row(
    comment_icon,
    Text(""12 Comments"").font_size(14).font_weight(700),
).gap(8).vertical_align('center')

# --- 3. Assemble the final card ---
main_card = Row(
    vote_section.padding(0, 15, 0, 0),
    Column(post_header, post_title, post_footer).gap(10)
).padding(20).background_color(""white"").border_radius(10).size(width=600).box_shadows(
    Shadow(offset=(5, 5), blur_radius=10, color=""#00000033"")
)

# --- 4. Render on a canvas ---
canvas = Canvas().background_color(LinearGradient([""#F0F2F5"", ""#DAE0E6""])).padding(40)
image = canvas.render(main_card)
image.save(""reddit_card.png"")
```

---

### What My Project Does

It's a layout engine that renders to an image. You build your image by nesting components (`Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Image`), and the library figures out all the sizing and positioning for you, using a model inspired by CSS Flexbox. You can style any element with padding, borders, backgrounds, and shadows. It also handles fonts and emojis, automatically finding fallbacks if a character isn't supported.

### Target Audience

It's for any Python dev who wants to create images from code, especially when the content is dynamic. For example:
*   Automating social media posts or quote images.
*   Generating Open Graph images for a website on the fly.
*   Creating parts of an infographic or a report.

The project is currently in Beta. It's pretty solid for most common use cases, but you might still find some rough edges.

### Comparison

*   **vs. Pillow/OpenCV:** Think of Pillow/OpenCV as a digital canvas where you have to specify the exact `(x, y)` coordinates for everything you draw. This library is more of a layout manager: you describe *how* elements should be arranged, and it does the math for you.
*   **vs. HTML/CSS-to-Image libraries:** They're powerful, but they usually require a full web browser engine (like Chrome) to work, which can be a heavy dependency. This library uses Skia directly and is a standard `pip install`.

I'm still working on it, and any feedback or suggestions are very welcome.

1nbugq8,Error en Visual Studio Code: Terminal lenta y problema con la base de datos al usar Flask y GitHub.,"Hola a todos,

Necesito su ayuda con un problema que estoy teniendo con mi proyecto de Python/Flask en Visual Studio Code. He intentado varias cosas, pero no he logrado resolverlo.

Antecedentes del problema

Anteriormente, utilizaba GitHub Desktop para gestionar mis repositorios. De repente, me empezó a dar un error que decía que no podía encontrar el repositorio local, a pesar de que los archivos seguían en mi computadora.

Mi solución temporal fue clonar de nuevo el repositorio, y eso funcionó para GitHub Desktop. Sin embargo, ahora tengo un problema en Visual Studio Code que no sé cómo solucionar.

El problema actual

Terminal excesivamente lenta: Cuando uso la terminal de Visual Studio Code para ejecutar comandos como flask db init o flask run, el proceso se vuelve muy lento. Aunque eventualmente me muestra que el proceso fue exitoso, el tiempo de espera es anormal.

No se visualiza la base de datos: A pesar de que la terminal indica que el comando flask db init se ejecutó correctamente, no puedo ver la base de datos (generalmente un archivo .db) en el explorador de archivos de Visual Studio Code. Es como si el archivo no se estuviera creando o se estuviera creando en un lugar incorrecto, aunque no me lanza ningún error.

Lo que he revisado

Revisé que mi entorno virtual (venv) esté activado correctamente.

Confirmé que los archivos del proyecto, como app.py y config.py, están bien configurados para la base de datos.

Verifiqué que el archivo del repositorio está en el mismo lugar de siempre en mi computadora.

Mis preguntas

¿Podría este problema estar relacionado con la forma en que GitHub Desktop maneja los repositorios?

¿Hay alguna configuración específica en Visual Studio Code que deba revisar?

¿Cómo puedo solucionar la lentitud de la terminal y asegurar que la base de datos se cree y se muestre en mi explorador de archivos?

Agradezco de antemano cualquier sugerencia o ayuda que puedan darme.

1nbmdj7,Aicontextator - A CLI tool to safely bundle your project's code for LLMs,"

Hi,

I'm David. I built Aicontextator to scratch my own itch. I was spending way too much time manually gathering and pasting code files into LLM web UIs. It was tedious, and I was constantly worried about accidentally pasting an API key or another secret.

Aicontextator is a simple CLI tool built with Python that automates this entire process. You run it in your project directory, and it bundles all the relevant files into a single, clean string ready for your prompt.

The GitHub repo is here: [https://github.com/ILDaviz/aicontextator](https://github.com/ILDaviz/aicontextator)

I'd love to get your feedback and suggestions!

**What My Project Does**

Aicontextator is a command-line utility designed to make it easier and safer to provide code context to Large Language Models. Its main features are:

* **Context Bundling:** It recursively finds all files in your project, respects your `.gitignore` rules, and concatenates them into a single string for easy copy-pasting.
* **Security First:** It uses the `detect-secrets` engine to scan every file *before* adding it to the context. If it finds a potential secret (like an API key or password), it warns you and excludes that line, preventing accidental leaks.
* **User-Friendly Features:** It includes an interactive mode to visually select which files to include, a token counter to stay within the LLM's context limit, and the ability to automatically split the output into multiple chunks if the context is too large.

**Target Audience**

This tool is for any developer who regularly uses LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) for coding assistance, debugging, or documentation. It's particularly useful for those working on projects with a non-trivial number of files (e.g., web developers, data scientists, backend engineers) where manually providing context is impractical. It's designed as a practical utility to be integrated into a daily development workflow, not just a toy project.

**Comparison with Alternatives**

* **vs. Manual Copy-Pasting:** This is the most common method, but it's slow, error-prone (it's easy to miss a file), and risky (you might accidentally paste a file like `.env`). Aicontextator automates this, making it fast, comprehensive, and safe.
* **vs. IDE Extensions (e.g., GitHub Copilot Chat, Cursor):** These tools are powerful but tie you to a specific editor and often a specific LLM ecosystem. Aicontextator is **editor-agnostic** and **LLM-agnostic**. It generates a simple string that you can use in any web UI or API you prefer, giving you complete flexibility.
* **vs. Other Context-Aware CLI Tools:** Many alternative tools try to be full-fledged chat clients in your terminal. Aicontextator has a much simpler scope: it does one thing and does it well. It focuses solely on **preparing the context**, acting as a powerful pre-processor for any LLM interaction, without forcing you into a specific chat interface.

1nakbd6,Python-JSON-Logger v4.0.0.rc1 Released,"Hi All, maintainer of [python-json-logger](https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger) here with a new (pre) release for you.

It can be installed using `python-json-logger==4.0.0.rc1`

# What's new?

This release has a few quality of life improvements that also happen to be breaking changes. The [full change log is here](https://nhairs.github.io/python-json-logger/4.0.0/changelog/) but to give an overview:

**Support for** `ext://` **when using** `dictConfig` **/** `fileConfig`

This allows you to reference Python objects in your config for example:

    version: 1
    disable_existing_loggers: False
    formatters:
      default:
        ""()"": pythonjsonlogger.json.JsonFormatter
        format: ""%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(module)s %(funcName)s %(lineno)s %(message)s""
        json_default: ext://logging_config.my_json_default
        rename_fields:
          ""asctime"": ""timestamp""
          ""levelname"": ""status""
        static_fields:
          ""service"": ext://logging_config.PROJECT_NAME
          ""env"": ext://logging_config.ENVIRONMENT
          ""version"": ext://logging_config.PROJECT_VERSION
          ""app_log"": ""true""
    handlers:
      default:
        formatter: default
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        stream: ext://sys.stderr
      access:
        formatter: default
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        stream: ext://sys.stdout
    loggers:
      uvicorn.error:
        level: INFO
        handlers:
          - default
        propagate: no
      uvicorn.access:
        level: INFO
        handlers:
          - access
        propagate: no

**Support for easier to use formats**

We now support a comma `style="",""` style which lets use a comma seperate string to specific fields.

    formatter = JsonFormatter(""message,asctime,exc_info"", style="","")

We also using any sequence of strings (e.g. lists or tuples).

    formatter = JsonFormatter([""message"", ""asctime"", ""exc_info""])

# What is Python JSON Logger

If you've not heard of this package, Python JSON Logger enables you produce JSON logs when using Python's `logging` package.

JSON logs are machine readable allowing for much easier parsing and ingestion into log aggregation tools.

For example here is the (formatted) log output of one of my programs:

    {
      ""trace_id"": ""af922f04redacted"",
      ""request_id"": ""cb1499redacted"",
      ""parent_request_id"": null,
      ""message"": ""Successfully imported redacted"",
      ""levelname"": ""INFO"",
      ""name"": ""redacted"",
      ""pathname"": ""/code/src/product_data/consumers/games.py"",
      ""lineno"": 41,
      ""timestamp"": ""2025-09-06T08:00:48.485770+00:00""
    }

# Why post to Reddit?

Although Python JSON Logger [is in the top 300 downloaded packaged from PyPI](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) (in the last month it's been downloaded more times that UV! ... just), there's not many people watching the repository [after it changed hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hcm2rr/pythonjsonlogger_has_changed_hands/) at the end of 2024.

1nb05ab,Prompt components - a better library for managing LLM prompts,"I started an Agentic AI company that has recently winded down, and we're happy to open source this library for managing prompts for LLMs!


### What My Project Does

Create components (blocks of text) that can be composed and shared across different prompts. This library enables isolated testing of each component, with support for standard python string formatting and jinja2.

The library came about because we were pulling our hair out trying to re-use different prompts across our codebase.

### Target Audience

This library is for you if you:

\- have written templates for LLMs and want proper type hint support

\- want a clean way to share blocks of text between prompts

### Comparison

Standard template engines lack clear ways to organize shared text between different prompts.

This library utilizes dataclasses to write prompts.

### Dataclasses for composable components

    @dataclass_component
    class InstructionsXml:
        _template = ""<instructions> {text} </instructions>""
        text: str
    
    @dataclass_component
    class Prompt(StringTemplate):
        _template = """"""
        ## AI Role
        {ai_role}
    
        ## Instructions
        {instructions}
        """"""
    
        ai_role: str
        instructions: Instructions
    
    prompt = Prompt(
        ai_role=""You are an expert coder."",
        instructions=Instructions(
           text=""Write python code to satisfy the user's query.""
        )
    )
    print(prompt.render()) # Renders the prompt as a string

The \`InstructionsXml\` component can be used in other prompts and also is easily swapped out! More powerful constructs are possible using dataclass features + jinja2.

1nci9sw,"htms-js: Stream Async HTML, Stay SEO-Friendly","Hey everyone, I’ve been playing with web streams lately and ended up building [htms-js](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js), an experimental toolkit for streaming HTML in Node.js.

Instead of rendering the whole HTML at once, it processes it as a stream: tokenize → annotate → serialize. The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.

There’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.

It’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.

# Packages

This project contains multiple packages:

* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.
* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.
* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.

# 🚀 Quick start

# 1. Install

Use your preferred package manager to install the plugin:

    pnpm add htms-js

# 2. HTML with placeholders

    <!-- home-page.html -->
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang=""en"">
      <body>
        <h1>News feed</h1>
        <div data-htms=""loadNews"">Loading news…</div>
    
        <h1>User profile</h1>
        <div data-htms=""loadProfile"">Loading profile…</div>
      </body>
    </html>

# 3. Async tasks

    // home-page.js
    export async function loadNews() {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));
      return `<ul><li>Breaking story</li><li>Another headline</li></ul>`;
    }
    
    export async function loadProfile() {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 200));
      return `<div class=""profile"">Hello, user!</div>`;
    }

# 4. Stream it (Express)

    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';
    import Express from 'express';
    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';
    
    const app = Express();
    
    app.get('/', async (_req, res) => {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');
      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));
    });
    
    app.listen(3000);

Visit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.

>**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).

# Examples

* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)
* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)
* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git
    cd htms-js
    pnpm i && pnpm build
    
    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start

# How it works

1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.
2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.
3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.
4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.

Result: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead.",javascript,skarab42-dev,5,0.86,3,1757422838.0,https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js,https://reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1nci9sw/htmsjs_stream_async_html_stay_seofriendly/,,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:29:53.335732+00:00

1nch8to,javascript + ai backends: 16 reproducible failure modes (and the fixes you can apply from the client),"ever shipped a clean frontend, got a 200 ok, and the answer still pointed to the wrong doc? most “frontend bugs” in ai apps are actually backend reasoning failures that are *reproducible* and *fixable* with the right guardrails.

i compiled a Problem Map of 16 failure modes with minimal fixes. it’s vendor-agnostic, zero-SDK. you can enforce the acceptance contract from your js client and stop the whack-a-mole.

### before vs after (why this works)

* before: patch *after* output. add rerankers, regex, retries, one-off tool calls. the same bug returns somewhere else.

* after: check the semantic state before output. if unstable, loop/reset or refuse. once a mode is mapped, it *stays* fixed.

### quick triage for js devs

* wrong page or random citation → No.1 (hallucination & chunk drift) + No.8 (traceability)

* “nearest neighbors” are semantically wrong → No.5 (semantic ≠ embedding)

* long prompts go off the rails mid-chain → No.3 (long reasoning chains)

* confident nonsense → No.4 (bluffing / overconfidence)

* deploy hits cold indexes / wrong secrets → No.14–16 (bootstrap / deploy deadlocks)

### the acceptance contract (client-side)

target three numbers for every answer:

* ΔS ≤ 0.45  (semantic tension between question and draft answer)

* coverage ≥ 0.70  (evidence actually supports the claim)

* λ convergent  (no escalating hazard across steps)

if your backend can emit these, you can hard-gate on the client. minimal sketch:

```

async function ask(q) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/answer', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({q, accept: {deltaS: 0.45, coverage: 0.70}})
  }).then(r => r.json());

  const { text, metrics } = res; // { deltaS, coverage, lambda_state, trace }
  if (metrics.deltaS > 0.45 || metrics.coverage < 0.70 || metrics.lambda_state !== 'convergent') {
    // request a re-grounded attempt or show a transparent fallback
    return { text: 'regrounding…', retry: true, trace: metrics.trace };
  }
  return { text, trace: metrics.trace };
}

```

### trace headers you should insist on

* chunk ids + offsets (so you can jump back to the exact source)

* embedding model + metric (cosine vs dot, normalized?)

* index build id (detect stale or fragmented stores)

* acceptance metrics (ΔS, coverage, λ_state)

### when things break, map to a number (then fix it once)

* multi-language answers jump scripts → Language / LanguageLocale pages (tokenizer mismatch, analyzer skew)

* hybrid search returns “close but wrong” → RAG_VectorDB: metric mismatch

* html/pdf tables become prose and lose truth values → No.11 symbolic collapse

* multi-agent flows wait on each other forever → No.13 multi-agent chaos

bookmark this so you don’t have to remember which knob lives where:

if you try it, reply with the No. you hit and your stack (pgvector/faiss/elasticsearch, langchain/llamaindex/autogen, etc.). i can point you to the exact page for that mode and the smallest viable repair.

I love React, Vue, Svelte, etc. But the more I build, the more I realise that for most internal tools, dashboards, marketing sites, and CRUD apps.. a basic setup with vanilla JavaScript or even server-rendered HTML (like HTMX or Alpine.js) often gets the job done faster, with less complexity.

Frameworks introduce a lot of overhead:

* Routing, state management, hydration, bundling
* Dev tooling, build pipelines, dependency hell
* Constant updates and breaking changes

For small teams or solo devs, this can be a productivity killer.

I am not saying frameworks are bad, they shine in large-scale apps, SPAs, and highly interactive UIs. But I think we have normalized using them for everything, even when simpler solutions would suffice.

1ncc9zu,"[AskJS] Why isn't it more common to create cross-platform and portable applications and software using web technologies like JS, HTML and CSS ?","I try to get rid of my reliance on proprietary ~~(Microsoft)~~ software with open source projects as much as I can. And regardless of the type of open-source software I'm looking for, I realized I have the following criteria that often come up :

* OS compatibility : with Windows, Linux and MacOS
* Device compatibility : with PC, smartphone and tablet
* Out-of-the-box : No installation required, must be ready for use as is
* Portability : can be used from a USB
* No telemetry and no requirement to be connected to the internet
* Self-contained dependencies to avoid complicated set-ups
* Noob-friendly to download, execute and use by a tech-illiterate grandma

Optional criteria :

* Syncing available across devices
* Easy to change its source code to customize the software / web-app

I realize that pretty much all of these requirements are fulfilled with what would essentially be portable web-apps.

TiddlyWiki is one such example, it's a portable notebook that fits in one single HTML file (but I don't intend to do an implementation that extreme) and it works as intended.

Keep in mind that the alternatives for the type of software I'm looking for are not resource-intensive apps and are often light-weight :

* Notes-taking markdown app (like Obsidian) / or text editor
* E-book and manga reader that supports different file formats (PDF, EPUB, CBZ, etc.) and annotation
* Very simple raster graphics editor like Paint
* File converters
* Meme maker

All of this being said, it cirlces back to my initial question :

Why isn't it more commonplace to use basic web technologies to create open-source projects for light-weight applications ? They seem to offer so much apparent advantages in addition to the fact that every OS and every device has a browser where these ""apps"" can run seamlessly.

1nah91d,[AskJS] connecting backend with Primavera P6,"Hello everyone, I've been working on connecting the Primavera P6 API with my website for the past few weeks, but I'm stuck and could really use some help. Here's what I've done so far: I created a CLI-based user to generate the key and secret key required for configuration. I successfully connected to the Primavera API and obtained the token. I've tested this setup on both Windows and WSL environments, but for some reason, I can't get it to function properly.

  
From my browser and Postman on Windows (with VPN on), Primavera API responds correctly. But from my Node.js backend running inside WSL2 Ubuntu, I get `EHOSTUNREACH`.  
This suggests either:

* WSL’s virtual network doesn’t inherit VPN routes,
* Or the Primavera server/firewall only accepts traffic from the Windows IP, not WSL’s internal IP. Can you confirm whether Primavera is reachable from Linux/WSL, or if it only allows traffic from specific networks or subnets?

1na2gpe,ffetch 2.0 released - Enhanced fetch() wrapper with proper AbortSignal handling,"Just released v2.0 of ffetch, my fetch wrapper that adds timeouts, retries, and circuit breaking without changing fetch semantics.

Major improvements in 2.0:

* Fixed AbortSignal.any fallback that was ignoring user signals
* Manual timeout implementation removes AbortSignal.timeout dependency
* Proper signal composition for complex abort scenarios
* transformRequest hook now preserves signals correctly
* Revamped documentation

The signal handling was surprisingly tricky - combining user AbortSignals with timeout signals while maintaining compatibility across environments. Had to implement manual fallbacks for AbortSignal.any since it's not available everywhere.

Example of the signal composition in action:

    const controller = new AbortController()
    const client = createClient({ timeout: 5000 })
    
    // Both user signal AND timeout signal work together
    client('/api/data', { signal: controller.signal })

Still zero deps, \~2KB, drop-in fetch replacement. The goal was to make fetch() reliable without changing its behavior.

1n8ukb3,Mermaid Editor/Renderer,"Hey,

I write a tech blog and I need to create lots of diagrams for it. I like using Mermaid, but I quickly ran into the same frustrating pattern with most of the existing editors and renderers: the free options were either too limited or came with barriers that slowed me down. I wanted something simple: just open the page, paste/type in Mermaid code, preview the diagram, and export it without worrying about limits or accounts.

Here are some concrete problems I ran into with other tools:

\- Mermaid Live Editor (the official one): Great for quick editing, but exporting diagrams is capped by a rate limit on their free tier. After a handful of exports, I’d get the dreaded “free tier limit exceeded” message.

Kroki.io: Supports rendering, but running it online requires trusting a shared service with my diagrams. Hosting it myself means extra setup, Docker, and server resources — not ideal if I just want to save a few diagrams.

\- Excalidraw & Lucidchart: Both have nice UIs, but they’re general diagramming tools, not native Mermaid editors. Lucidchart especially locks useful features (like unlimited diagrams or high-quality export) behind a paid plan.

\- Other browser-based tools Almost all I tried had some kind of paywall, signup requirement, or watermark on exports. For something as text-based and simple as Mermaid, that felt unnecessary.

So I built my own tool with a few core principles:

\- No limits: you can create, edit, and export as many diagrams as you want.

\- No signup: the tool works straight from the browser, nothing to install.

\- No tracking: privacy-friendly, just you and your diagrams.

\- Open source: [https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor](https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor)

1n83l78,"I built USAL.js - a 9KB scroll animation library with text effects and framework support for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular + Web Components","I just released USAL.js - a scroll animation library I built because I was frustrated with existing options for text animations.

# The Problem

I needed word-by-word and letter-by-letter animations for a client project. AOS.js and SAL.js are great, but they don't handle text splitting well, and most libraries don't support web components.

# What I Built

* **9KB minified** (smaller than most images) (5KB Gzipped)
* **40+ animations** (fade, zoom, flip with all directions)
* **Text animations** (split by word/letter, shimmer effects, counters)
* **Framework packages** for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Lit
* **Web Components support** (rare in animation libs)
* **Zero dependencies**

# Quick Examples

**Basic usage:**

    <script src=""https://cdn.usal.dev/latest""></script>
    <div data-usal=""fade-u duration-800"">Fades up smoothly</div>

**Text animations:**

    <p data-usal=""split-word split-fade-r split-delay-200"">
      Each word appears from right
    </p>

**Number counters:**

    <span data-usal=""count-[1234] duration-2000"">1234</span>

**React integration:**

    npm install /react
    
    import { USALProvider } from '@usal/react';
    
    <USALProvider>
      <h1 data-usal=""fade-u"">Animated in React</h1>
    </USALProvider>

# Why Another Animation Library?

* **Tailwind-inspired syntax** (duration-800, delay-200)
* **Text-first approach** (word/letter splitting built-in)
* **True framework agnostic** (even supports Web Components)
* **Performance focused** (60fps with hundreds of elements)

I started with SAL.js as inspiration but ended up rewriting everything from scratch to get the text animations and framework support I wanted.

1ndajmq,[D] Questions on Fairness and Expectations in Top-Tier Conference Submissions,"Hello everyone,

I know that in this community there are many experienced researchers and even reviewers for top-tier conferences. As a young researcher, I sincerely hope to learn from your perspectives and get some clarity on a few concerns I’ve been struggling with.

**My first question:**  
Does a research paper always need to achieve *state-of-the-art (SOTA)* results—outperforming every existing method—to be accepted at an A\* conference? I often feel that so many published papers present dazzling results, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to surpass them.

**My second question, about fairness and accuracy in comparisons:**  
When evaluating a new method, is it acceptable to compare primarily against the most “related,” “similar,” or “same-family” methods rather than the absolute SOTA? For example:

* If I make a small modification to the Bagging procedure in Random Forest, would it be fair to compare only against other Bagging-based forests, rather than something fundamentally different like XGBoost (which is boosting-based)?
* Similarly, if I improve a variant of SVM, is it reasonable to compare mainly with other margin-based or kernel methods, instead of tree-based models like Decision Trees?

I understand that if my method only beats some similar baselines but does not surpass the global best-performing method, reviewers might see it as “meaningless” (since people naturally gravitate toward the top method). Still, I’d like to hear your thoughts: from an experienced researcher’s point of view, what is considered fair and convincing in such comparisons?

Thank you very much in advance for your time and advice.",MachineLearning,Feuilius,3,0.62,6,1757500247.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndajmq/d_questions_on_fairness_and_expectations_in/,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndajmq/d_questions_on_fairness_and_expectations_in/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:30:43.774213+00:00

1ndgutf,[D] Is lowering error rates more impactful than higher benchmarks?,"The biggest impact I noticed when moving from GPT-4.1 to GPT-5 wasn’t the benchmark score improvements. It was the reduction in error rate.

When solving harder tasks, the difference feels very practical: far fewer retries, much less wasted context, lower time and token cost.

It makes me wonder:

Do we sometimes conflate “ability” with “reliability”?  
Could lowering error rates be a more important research direction than pushing benchmarks higher?  
How do researchers here think about measuring and prioritizing this tradeoff?

I’d love to hear from people who approach this more systematically.  
(For context: I’m not a researcher myself, but a founder and heavy LLM user sharing observations.)



# (Edit)

Quick clarification: when I say ""error rate"" I mean real-world, user-facing error rate — i.e., how often a model's output is usable for the task without corrective interaction, not just benchmark accuracy.

Benchmarks are useful and I'm not dismissing them, but they don't always capture the cost of hallucinations: retries, lost context, wasted time, wrong actions. In practice, things like:

task success rate (end-to-end), average retries or clarification turns, human correction time or token cost, false-positive hallucinations vs refusal rate.

These often matter more to whether I can actually reach a goal efficiently.

What I'd really like to hear are perspectives on how the field should think about this distinction. Should reliability (in the sense of fewer misleading outputs) be treated as a separate axis of progress from raw benchmark scores?",MachineLearning,RM-Li,0,0.43,12,1757517056.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndgutf/d_is_lowering_error_rates_more_impactful_than/,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ndgutf/d_is_lowering_error_rates_more_impactful_than/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:30:46.786693+00:00

1ncq2yg,[D] Graphrag  pipeline that runs entirely locally with ollama and has full source attribution,"I built a Graph RAG pipeline (VeritasGraph) that runs entirely locally with Ollama (Llama 3.1) and has full source attribution.

I've been deep in the world of local RAG and wanted to share a project I built, VeritasGraph, that's designed from the ground up for private, on-premise use with tools we all love.

My setup uses Ollama with llama3.1 for generation and nomic-embed-text for embeddings. The whole thing runs on my machine without hitting any external APIs.

The main goal was to solve two big problems:

Multi-Hop Reasoning: Standard vector RAG fails when you need to connect facts from different documents. VeritasGraph builds a knowledge graph to traverse these relationships.

Trust & Verification: It provides full source attribution for every generated statement, so you can see exactly which part of your source documents was used to construct the answer.

One of the key challenges I ran into (and solved) was the default context length in Ollama. I found that the default of 2048 was truncating the context and leading to bad results. The repo includes a Modelfile to build a version of llama3.1 with a 12k context window, which fixed the issue completely.

The project includes:

The full Graph RAG pipeline.

A Gradio UI for an interactive chat experience.

1ncdt5o,[P] Implementation and ablation study of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM): what really drives performance?,"I recently implemented the [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734) (HRM) for educational purposes and applied it to a simple pathfinding task. You can watch the model solve boards step by step in the generated animated GIF.

HRM is inspired by multi-timescale processing in the brain: a slower H module for abstract planning and a faster L module for low-level computation, both based on self-attention. HRM is an attempt to model reasoning in latent space.

To understand a bit better what drives the performance I ran a small ablation study. Key findings (full results in the README):

* The biggest driver of performance (both accuracy and refinement ability) is training with more segments (outer-loop refinement), not architecture.
* The two-timescale H/L architecture performs about the same as a single-module trained with BPTT.
* Notably, H/L still achieves good performance/refinement without full BPTT, which could mean cheaper training.

Repo: [https://github.com/krychu/hrm](https://github.com/krychu/hrm)

This is of course a limited study on a relatively simple task, but I thought the results might be interesting to others exploring reasoning models.

The findings line up with the ARC Prize team's analysis: [https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis](https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis)

Below two examples of refinement in action: early steps explore solution with rough guesses, later steps make smaller and smaller corrections until the full path emerges:

1nc5jb5,"[R] LLMs play a cooperative card game, coordination without communication","One of my favorite card games is called The Crew, which is a trick-taking game (like hearts) but cooperative. There's no table talk allowed, players have to coordinate silently (with limited options for in-game communication) - figuring out what their teammates are doing and why, and what they need to do to work together. I wondered what SOTA LLMs would do if you asked them to play. To make this work, I implemented a backend for the game logic and structured outputs so models play by submitting moves and reasoning at each turn. 

Originally I wanted to re-create the 50 mission campaign, but models were so spotty on  mission 1 (the simplest possible mission) that I stuck to mission 1 and experimented with different configurations instead. I ran 8 OpenAI models on 10 different versions, ranging from very easy (random chance gets you there 2/3rds of the time) to very hard (random chance succeeds 0.5%), and gave each model ten trials on each mission.

What I've found out:

\* Smaller models struggle both with gameplay, and with understanding their role on the team. In these missions, a designated player (the commander) has to win a designated card. But these models hate having to lose a trick for the sake of their teammate, even when that's how they win the game.

[This does not \\""help him secure the win and fulfill his task.\\"" It loses the game.](https://preview.redd.it/3lqyqf3tg1of1.png?width=2030&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57c0a46fee169e14dbf6fc0cda107024a11a59e)

\* GPT-4o-mini (worst model so far) plays randomly on easy setups and worse than randomly on harder ones. GPT-4o-mini in particular loses the game in the first turn almost 90% of the time in harder setups with GPT-5-nano and GPT-4.1-mini are close behind at 60-70%. 

[GREEN 1 is the lowest GREEN card in the game, so playing it straight away actually guarantees immediate failure.](https://preview.redd.it/fx5jqyhug1of1.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=da5d4abb5a7fcd4c1e8ee42c09d7acfb4a7ba5dc)

\* GPT-5 is self-aware enough to avoid the ""losing on the very first turn"" error, but actually did it on purpose once as a deliberate suicide when it saw that it couldn't win the game on the very first turn.

[There are multiple turns in the game!](https://preview.redd.it/91qnnfuvg1of1.jpg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebc98a3fbf4381c4a95f7e96ec2fa96f8e84692f)

\* The harder missions - which require coordination across multiple turns - absolutely cook the smaller models with <10% win rates. Only GPT-5 is beating random chance on the harder missions (73% GPT-5 vs 4% random) 

\* GPT-5 also found optimal 1-trick solutions to a couple of setups I thought required at least two tricks. Oops. So in a sense, we're above human performance in some areas.

\* ...But most of the time, GPT-5 generally screwed around for 3 or more tricks in puzzles it could have solved in 1. This is like solving a mate in one chess puzzle in 3 moves. It's not losing, but it's not exactly showing a mastery of the game.

\* The lack of goal-oriented behavior (or risk-averse hesitation) on GPT-5's part means that GPT-5-mini actually performs better if we count speed (number of turns) to win as criteria and grade on optimal play (winning in the least number of turns, rather than just winning.)

1ncrkpp,[D] Negative R² on unseen dataset despite good train/test performance,"I am working on a regression problem where I predict Pavement Condition Index (PCI) values from multi-sensor time-series data collected in the same region and under the same conditions. I have multiple sets of data from the same collection process, where I use some sets for training and testing and keep the remaining ones for evaluating generalization. Within the training and testing sets, the model performs well, but when I test on the held-out dataset from the same collection, the R² value often becomes negative , even though the mean absolute error and root mean square error remain reasonable. I have experimented with several feature engineering strategies, including section-based, time-based, and distance-based windowing, and I have tried using raw PCI data as well. I also tested different window lengths and overlap percentages, but the results remain inconsistent. I use the same data for a classification task, the models perform very well and generalize properly, yet for PCI regression, the generalization fails despite using the same features and data source. In some cases, removing features like latitude, longitude, or timestamps caused performance to drop significantly, which raises concerns that the model might be unintentionally relying on location and time information instead of learning meaningful patterns from sensor signals. I have also experimented with different models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, but the issue persists. I suspect the problem may be related to the variance of the target PCI values across datasets, potential data leakage caused by overlapping windows, or possibly a methodological flaw in how the evaluation is performed. I want to understand whether it is common in research to report only the R² values on the train/test splits from the same dataset, or whether researchers typically validate on entirely separate held-out sets as well.

1nc6r7l,[Project] Otters 🦦 - A minimal vector search library with powerful metadata filtering,"I'm excited to share something I've been working on for the past few weeks:

Otters 🦦 - A minimal vector search library with powerful metadata filtering powered by an ergonomic Polars-like expressions API written in Rust!

Why I Built This

In my day-to-day work, I kept hitting the same problem. I needed vector search with sophisticated metadata filtering, but existing solutions were either,
Too bloated (full vector databases when I needed something minimal for analysis)
Limited in filtering capabilities
Had unintuitive APIs that I was not happy about.

I wanted something minimal, fast, and with an API that feels natural - inspired by Polars, which I absolutely love.

What Makes Otters Different

Exact Search: Perfect for small-to-medium datasets (up to ~10M vectors) where accuracy matters more than massive scale.

 Performance: 
SIMD-accelerated scoring
Zonemaps and Bloom filters for intelligent chunk pruning

Polars-Inspired API: Write filters as simple expressions
```
meta_store.query(query_vec, Metric::Cosine)
    .meta_filter(col(""price"").lt(100) & col(""category"").eq(""books""))
    .vec_filter(0.8, Cmp::Gt)
    .take(10)
    .collect()
```

The library is in very early stages and there are tons of features that i want to add
Python bindings, NumPy support
Serialization and persistence
Parquet / Arrow integration
Vector quantization
etc.

I'm primarily a Python/JAX/PyTorch developer, so diving into rust programming has been an incredible learning experience.

If you think this is interesting and worth your time, please give it a try.
I welcome contributions and feedback !

1ncyqf9,[D] Metacognitive prompting improves AbstentionBench performance by 10 points,"Hey r/MachineLearning,

I'm not a researcher, just someone interested in LLMs, but I stumbled on something that might be of interest to this community.

TL;DR: By prompting Claude (the only model I tried) to engage in explicit metacognition about its own knowledge limitations, I achieved 70% accuracy on AbstentionBench (Parrish et al., 2025) compared to their reported ~60% baseline. The model showed interesting patterns in where it chose to abstain vs. answer.

Background: AbstentionBench tests whether LLMs know when to say ""I don't know."" it includes questions with false premises, unknowable answers, and context-dependent ambiguities. The benchmark paper shows that scaling and reasoning-focused training make models worse at abstention, degrading performance by 24%.

Method: Instead of treating this as a pure patternmatching task, I prompted the model to: Consider its own knowledge boundaries. Engage in metacognitive evaluation of confidence levels. Acknowledge uncertainty as a valid response. Think about whether it actually knows something vs. can generate something plausible.

Essentially, I framed the task as requiring genuine self-monitoring rather than next-token prediction.

Results: Paper's reported baseline: ~60% With metacognitive prompting: 70% agreement with benchmark labels. The model (Claude) performed near-perfectly on false premise questions (core abstention use case). There was some interesting variation across categories: The model was strong on factual unknowables and false premises. Very conservative on moral/ethical scenarios (abstained on all), and mixed on subjective or ambiguous questions.

Why this might be interesting:

A 10-point improvement from prompting alone suggests abstention behavior is quite malleable.

The category-specific patterns might reveal how different types of uncertainty are processed.

Metacognitive prompting appears to increase caution across the board, sometimes matching and sometimes exceeding benchmark expectations.

Caveats: N=1 (just tested on Claude, needs replication on other models) No controlled baseline (comparing to paper's reported numbers) Manual evaluation of a subset of questions (60 questions). Small sample size would benefit from full dataset evaluation.

Questions for the community:

Has anyone else experimented with metacognitive or self-awareness prompting for abstention?

Are there other benchmarks that might show similar prompting effects?

Any suggestions for automating the evaluation to test on the full dataset?

I emailed one of the benchmark authors but haven't heard back yet. I'd be happy to share the specific prompts and methodology if anyone wants to attempt replication (DM me). Even a 10% improvement from prompting strategy alone seems worth investigating further.

Edit: To be clear, I'm not making claims about consciousness or sentience, just that prompting for self-monitoring behavior appears to meaningfully affect abstention patterns.",MachineLearning,Intraluminal,0,0.36,4,1757460912.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ncyqf9/d_metacognitive_prompting_improves/,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ncyqf9/d_metacognitive_prompting_improves/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:30:56.830541+00:00

1nc1mxq,[Project] Phishing URL detection with Random Forests and handcrafted features,"**\[Project\] Phishing URL detection with Random Forests on handcrafted features** 

I recently finished a project where I trained and deployed a phishing URL detector using **traditional ML techniques**. The goal was to explore how far a lightweight, interpretable model could go for this problem before moving to deep learning.

**Data & Features**

* Dataset: Combined PhishTank + Kaggle phishing URLs with Alexa top legitimate domains.
* Preprocessing: Removed duplicates, balanced classes, stratified train/test split.
* Features (hand-engineered):
   * URL length & token counts
   * Number of subdomains, “@” usage, hyphens, digits
   * Presence of IP addresses instead of domains
   * Keyword-based flags (e.g., “login”, “secure”)

**Model & Training**

* Algorithm: Random Forest (scikit-learn).
* Training: 80/20 split, 10-fold CV for validation.
* Performance: \~92% accuracy on test data.
* Feature importance: URL length, IP usage, and hyphen frequency were the strongest predictors.

**Takeaways**

* A simple RF + handcrafted features still performs surprisingly well on phishing detection.
* Interpretability (feature importances) adds practical value in a security context.
* Obvious limitations: feature set is static, adversaries can adapt.

**Future work (exploration planned)**

* Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) for comparison.
* Transformers or CNNs on raw URL strings (to capture deeper patterns).
* Automating retraining pipelines with fresh phishing feeds.

1nbisbw,[D] How to Automate parsing of Bank Statement PDFs to extract transaction level data,"I am working on a project where I need to extract transaction data from Bank Statement PDFs. 80% of my working PDFs are digitally generated so to handle those I put the Regex approach, where I first extract the text into a txt file and then run Regex on this data to extract data in a meaningful format \[Date, Particulars, Credit/Debit amount, Balance\]. The challenge is that the Regex approach is brittle, and very sensitive to formats. So every bank requires a new Regex plus any little change in the format tomorrow by the bank will break the pipeline.

I want to make a pipeline which is agnostic to bank-format and is capable of extracting the info from the PDFs. I cannot use any 3rd party APIs as the bank data is sensitive and we want to keep everything on internal servers.

Hence, I have been exploring ways in Open Source models to built this pipeline. After doing some research, I landed on LayoutLMv3 Model which can essentially label the Tokens based on their location on the page so if we are able to train the model on our data it should be able to tag every token on the page and that should do it, but the challenge here is that this model is sensitive to reading order and fails on few bank formats.

Since then I have explored MinerU but that failed as well, it isolated the transaction content table but later failed to extract data in orderly fashion as it could not differentiate between multiple lines of transactions.

Now I am working with YOLOv8 which I am training to identify transaction rows and amount columns using BBox and then I will pull the info from these BBox intersection. But the confidence here is not very high.

Has anyone here faced similar challenge? Can anyone help me with some solution or approach. It would be a great help!

1naz0eb,[D] Vibe-coding and structure when writing ML experiments,"Hey!

For context, I'm a Master's student at ETH Zürich. A friend and I recently tried writing a paper for a NeurIPS workshop, but ran into some issues.  
We had both a lot on our plate and probably used LLMs a bit too much. When evaluating our models, close to the deadline, we caught up on some bugs that made the data unreliable. We also had plenty of those bugs along the way. I feel like we shot ourselves in the foot but that's a lesson learned the way. Also, it made me realise the negative effects it could have had if those bugs had been kept uncaught.

I've been interning in some big tech companies, and so I have rather high-standard for clean code. Keeping up with those standards would be unproductive at our scale, but I must say I've struggled finding a middle ground between speed of execution and code's reliability.

For researchers on this sub, do you use LLMs at all when writing ML experiments? If yes, how much so? Any structure you follow for effective experimentation (writing (ugly) code is not always my favorite part)? When doing experimentation, what structure do you tend to follow w.r.t collaboration?

1naejuk,[D] The apparent randomness of residual block design,"Skip connections and residual blocks have been ubiquitous in the ML field ever since the original ResNets were published. I think it's fair to say most people agree skip connections help, but at a glance, the design of the residual blocks themselves is still something that differs from paper to paper.

The most recent ""innovation"" is splitting channel mixing from spatial mixing, which is what ConvNeXt does in an attempt to mimic transformers. Other models that also claim SotA-ish performance, however, do not necessarily follow suit. NFNet, for example, employs grouped 3x3 convolution layers, good old normal bottlenecks (not inverted) and channel attention (Squeeze-and-Excitation).

If we look at modern LLMs, they all have residual blocks that look very similar, but with one or two minor differences that often look arbitrary.

I think residual block design is one of those things that people don't really pay much attention to since it generally works well enough regardless of what you do, but at some point it does look like we're just making semi-random decisions based on semi-random observations. Why the block is designed in the way it is is rarely a point of concern.

I've tried looking for papers making direct comparisons between different design choices, but I couldn't really find anything conclusive.

• Domain Expertise – ingesting architecture docs, API specs, etc.

1nahnmz,[D] Thought experiment: “Rolling without slipping” as a blueprint for nD→(n−1) embeddings?,"I came across the recent ROLLING HONED paper (designing 3D shapes that, when rolling without slipping, trace arbitrary 2D paths). It got me thinking:

In 3D, rolling constraints let you encode a 2D trajectory into the geometry of a 3D body.

In principle, in 4D you could imagine a convex hypersurface rolling on a 3D hyperplane, tracing out a 3D trajectory.

More generally: could there be a systematic way to map nD data into (n−1)D dynamics via such constraints?

I know in ML we already have PCA, autoencoders, product quantization, etc. — and those actually preserve metrics we care about. My hunch is that this “mechanical embedding” idea probably fails the usefulness test for similarity search (no guarantee of inner product preservation).

But still:

Does the analogy make any theoretical sense in higher dimensions (rolling manifolds w/o slip/twist)?

Could there be hidden value in treating “constrained dynamics” as a new kind of coding scheme?

Or am I over-romanticizing a neat geometric trick after too much late-night reading?

Curious what the community thinks — is there any research potential here, or should I file this under “fun alcohol-fueled metaphors” and move on?

1na5ixj,[D]Baseten raises $150M Series D for inference infra. where’s the real bottleneck?,"Baseten just raised $150M Series D at a $2.1B valuation. They focus on inference infra  like low latency serving, throughput optimization, developer experience.

They’ve shared benchmarks showing their embeddings inference outperforms vLLM and TEI, especially on throughput and latency. The bet is that inference infra is the pain point, not training.

But this raises a bigger question. what’s the real bottleneck in inference?
	•Baseten and others (Fireworks, Together) are competing on latency + throughput.
	•Some argue the bigger cost sink is cold starts and low GPU utilization , serving multiple models elastically without waste is still unsolved at scale.

I wonder what everyone thinks 

	•Will latency/throughput optimizations be enough to differentiate?
	•Or is utilization (how efficiently GPUs are used across workloads) the deeper bottleneck?
	•Does inference infra end up commoditized like training infra, or is there still room for defensible platforms?

1n9ufsf,[P] Knowledge Distillation for Text-to-SQL — Training GPT-2 with Qwen2-7B as Teacher,"Hey folks,

I’ve been working on an experiment that combines **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** with the **Text-to-SQL problem**, and I wanted to share the results + repo with the community.

# 🎯 Motivation

* Natural language → SQL is a powerful way for **non-technical users** to query databases without always relying on analysts.
* Most solutions use massive LLMs (GPT-4.1, etc.), but they’re **expensive**, **hard to deploy locally**, and raise **data privacy concerns**.
* So the question I asked: *Can a much smaller model (like GPT-2) be trained to generate SQL for a given DB effectively if it learns from a bigger LLM?*

# 🧠 Approach

I used **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** — i.e., transferring knowledge from a large teacher model into a smaller student model.

* **Teacher Model**: [Qwen2-7B]()
* **Student Model**: [GPT-2]()

Steps:

1. Built a **custom dataset** → pairs of (natural language query, SQL query) for a toy retail database schema.
2. Teacher (Qwen2-7B) generates SQL from the queries.
3. Student (GPT-2) is trained on two signals:
   * **Cross-Entropy Loss (75%)** → match ground-truth SQL.
   * **MSE Loss (25%)** → align with the teacher’s hidden state values (projected from teacher’s layer 25).
4. Trained for **20 epochs on Colab GPU**.

# ⚙️ Training Setup

* Teacher hidden states projected → aligned with GPT-2’s final hidden states.
* Loss = **0.75 \* CE + 0.25 \* MSE**.
* Achieved **total loss \~0.21** after training.

# 📊 Results

* GPT-2 (student) was able to **generate SQL queries directly from natural language** for the schema.
* While not perfect (due to limited resources at my disposal), it showed that **small models can be viable for domain-specific SQL generation** when trained this way.
* Benefits:
   * ⚡ Lightweight (runs locally).
   * 💸 Cost-efficient.
   * 🔐 More privacy-friendly than cloud-only LLM APIs.

# 📷 Visuals in the repo:

* Schema diagram (retail DB).
* Teacher → Student distillation architecture.
* Sample outputs (NL → SQL).

# 📎 Repo

Code + diagrams + outputs are here:  
👉 [GitHub: Knowledge Distillation for SQL generation on GPT-2](https://github.com/Gokul-GMenon/Knowledge_Distillation-SQL_generation_on_gpt_2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Would love feedback, suggestions, or discussions on:

* Other lightweight models worth trying as students (LLaMA-7B distilled further? Phi-2?).
* Improvements to the KD setup (layer selection, different projection strategies).
* Extensions: applying this to more complex schemas / real enterprise DBs.

Cheers!

1n9wnel,[P] An Open-Source Pipeline for Speech-to-Speech Translation with Voice Preservation (RVC) and Lip-Sync,"Hello [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),

I'm a final-year undergrad exploring multimodal systems, and I wanted to share a project I've built and open-sourced. It’s an end-to-end pipeline designed to tackle video dubbing for low-resource languages, using Telugu as the initial target. The system translates speech from an English video while preserving the original speaker's vocal identity and syncing their lips to the new audio.

* **GitHub Repo:** [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/M-SRIKAR-VARDHAN/speech-to-speech-with-lipsync)
* **Full Technical Write-up:** [\[writeup\]](https://medium.com/@srikarvardhan2005/speech-to-speech-translation-with-lip-sync-425d8bb74530)
* **Demo Video:** [\[Demo\]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l6jZEDdmUzr9VhfYkvoVdaXJSSipN-nm?usp=sharing)

The core technical challenge was achieving voice preservation without access to large, speaker-specific datasets typically required for high-fidelity voice cloning. After a dead-end attempting a direct S2S architecture inspired by Translatotron, I found that using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as a post-processing step on a generic TTS output was a surprisingly practical and data-efficient solution.

The final pipeline is structured as follows:

1. **ASR:** Whisper for robust transcription.
2. **NMT:** Meta's NLLB for English-to-Telugu translation.
3. **TTS:** Meta's MMS model to synthesize the base Telugu audio.
4. **Voice Conversion:** A trained RVC model converts the timbre of the synthetic speech to match the original speaker.
5. **Lip Sync:** Wav2Lip aligns the video frames to the new audio.

My main takeaway is that RVC seems to function as a very effective ""style transfer"" layer for voice, making it a viable tool for projects where full voice cloning is computationally or data-prohibitive.

I'm sharing this to start a discussion and get feedback from the community on this approach. I'm particularly curious about two points:

1. Has anyone else experimented with using RVC in a more formal pipeline, and what were the qualitative limitations you encountered?
2. Are there newer or more robust alternatives to Wav2Lip for lip-syncing that maintain good performance without requiring massive computational resources?

Any thoughts on the architecture or suggestions for improvement would be highly appreciated.

Other common flaws in existing benchmarks:

\- Too synthetic, when the aim is to catch real high-stakes hallucinations in production LLM use-cases.

\- Full of incorrect annotations regarding whether each LLM response is correct or not, due to either low-quality human review or just relying on automated LLM-powered annotation.

\- Only considering responses generated by old LLMs, which are no longer representative of the type of mistakes that modern LLMs make.

1n83e6e,[D] Performance overhead of running ML inference in hardware-isolated environments - production metrics,"Been collecting data on ML inference performance in trusted execution environments and thought the numbers might be useful for others dealing with similar constraints.

**Context:** Fraud detection models processing ~10M daily transactions, needed hardware-level isolation for compliance reasons.

After 3 months of production data, seeing 5-8% performance overhead compared to standard deployment. This is way better than the 30-40% overhead reported in older papers about SGX.

The interesting technical challenge was memory management. TEE environments have strict memory limits and different allocation patterns than standard containers. Had to completely rewrite our batching logic - what worked fine with dynamic batching in regular pods caused constant OOM errors in enclaves.

**Model optimization discoveries:**

- ONNX runtime worked, pytorch was too memory heavy
- Preprocessing became the bottleneck, not inference
- Had to keep models under 8GB total memory
- P95 latency went from 12ms to 13ms

Tried multiple approaches including raw SGX implementation and phala's abstraction layer. The attestation complexity alone makes raw implementation painful.

**For those working on similar problems:**
Profile your entire pipeline, not just model inference. Data transformation overhead in isolated environments is real.

**Technical question for the community:** 
How are you handling model updates in TEE environments? The attestation requirements make standard blue-green deployments complicated. Currently doing full enclave restarts but that means brief downtime.

Also curious if anyone's tried running transformer models larger than 1B params in TEE.

1ncq269,"We are the W3C WebDX Community Group, working to improve developer experience with projects like Baseline. Ask Us Anything!","Hi r/webdev! We are members of the W3C Web Developer Experience Community Group (WebDX CG) and we'll be hosting an AMA right here on Thursday, September 18th, starting at 9:00 AM ET. We're all about making your life as a web developer easier, and we're here to chat about our projects like Baseline, and answer all your burning questions.

**What is the WebDX CG?**

[Our mission](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/admin/blob/main/charter.md) is to improve your experience developing for the Web platform, through two main pillars:

1. Coordinating research to get a clear, data-driven picture of the major obstacles and gaps that developers face every day.
2. Building a shared understanding of the interoperable parts of the web platform to promote clear, consistent communication about which features developers can use confidently.

We are a group of browser vendors, developers, and other web stakeholders dedicated to identifying and smoothing out the sharp edges of web development.

**What do we actually work on?**

You may already be familiar with some of our work, including 

* [Baseline](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/): Baseline provides clear information about which web platform features are compatible across a core set of browsers. It gives developers confidence in the level of browser compatibility when reading articles or choosing libraries for their projects. By aligning with Baseline, developers can expect fewer surprises when testing their sites.
* Supporting Interoperability: Our work directly supports browser interoperability. By defining clear feature sets (like Baseline), we create a shared target for browser vendors and reduce the inconsistencies that cause developer frustration. Examples of projects built on this data include the [Web platform features explorer](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/) and [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev/). 
* Understanding developer needs: We facilitate and publish research like short surveys on MDN and the State of CSS, HTML, and JS surveys. We dig into the survey data and other developer signals to help the web platform ecosystem understand what you, the developers, need most.

**Who will be answering your questions?**

We have several members of the CG here to take your questions. Here's who's on the panel:

* François Daoust\* (u/Internal\_Self730), W3C Web Specialist
* Patrick Brosset\* (u/WebPlatformLover), Microsoft Edge PM
* Kadir Topal (u/aktopal), Google Chrome PM
* Philip Jägenstedt (u/foolip), Google Chrome Engineer
* Rachel Andrew (u/rachelandrew), Google Chrome DevRel
* Rick Viscomi (u/rviscomi), Google Chrome DevRel
* Jeremy Wagner (u/jlwagner), Google Chrome DevRel
* James Stuckey Weber (u/jamessw), OddBird Developer

*\* CG Chair*

**Ask Us Anything!**

We'll be here to answer your questions on Thursday, September 18th, starting at 9:00 AM ET.

We're ready to discuss:

* The methodology and future of Baseline
* How Baseline differs from other resources like MDN and Can I Use
* The biggest DX challenges you think the web faces
* How developer feedback influences browser interoperability
* How an individual developer can get involved and make their voice heard
* What our day-to-day work looks like in the CG

We're looking forward to a great discussion.

1ndbijs,Refresh token - stolen and 'real user' does not attempt a refresh until after cookie expires.,"Hi,

I'm trying to wrap my head around a situation where we have the below flow, and feel like i'm missing something. What happens if a refresh token is stolen, and the real user does not attempt to use their original refresh token until after it is expired? This is in the situation where a user can log in on multiple devices / browsers, so multiple Refresh Token chains could exist.

`Real Actor := RA, Malicious Actor := MA, Refresh Token (1day) := RT, Access Token (15min) := AT.`

1. RA logs in, and receives AT1 and RT1 stored in secure, HTTP cookies. RT1 is written to database for revocation/reuse detection purposes.
2. MA steals RT1 and uses this to refresh the access token. MA receives AT2 and RT2. RT2 is written to database, and RT1 is marked as revoked.
3. MA continues to act maliciously,.. MA receives AT7 and RT7. RT7 is written to database, and RT2-RT6 are marked as revoked.
4. RA does not perform any activity until after their RT1 has expired.

I understand that if RA used their RT1 prior to it expiring, then we would detect that they are using a revoked RT and then proceed with revoking all RTs, nullifying the impact of the malicious actor. However if RA does not use their RT until after the cookie expires, then when they go to use it they'll be forced to sign in again, and receive a new RT and start a new RT chain, but the existing RT chain that the malicious actor has will remain valid...

What am I missing here?

**Edit:**

* Is the answer not having the cookie that stores the refresh token (a JWT) expire? If this is the case, do we then just not worry about the JWT having expired (ie jwt.decode not jwt.verify when getting the JTI to look up in the database) when checking if it is a re-use?
* A secondary question, if the real actor never interacts back with the server, or does so on a totally new device (and therefor new refresh token chain), is there anyway to stop the malicious actor from continuing to act, or is it only if the real actor hits a 'log-out of all devices' button?",webdev,peoth,7,0.82,7,1757503466.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ndbijs/refresh_token_stolen_and_real_user_does_not/,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ndbijs/refresh_token_stolen_and_real_user_does_not/,,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:31:43.889413+00:00

1ncgxw1,"Vanilla JS/HTML in 2025: What’s the Best Way to Build a Web App Without React, Vue, or Svelte?”","I’ve been asked to build a KYC system. We’ll start with a small MVP:

* Collect user info,
* Store it in a database,
* Include basic authentication.

I've been debating with the right stack - especially for the frontend.

I love the DX of frameworks like Next.js, React Router, Solid, Svelte, and Astro. But they all ship extra JavaScript that users don’t need. For a little-to-no-interactive small app, that feels like overkill.

(I love the snapiness of a mimialminimal JS-free site!) 

I’m debating:

* **Qwik**: It's a framework. But, minimal JS is shipped to the browser. I'm unsure if it’s easy for new teammates to pick up or it becomes too niche (Remember we're in a B2B setting and long term support matters)
* **HTMX**: I like it a lot, but then my head starts spinning with the details:
   * **Minification** – What tool should I use? Vite/Rollup expect a single entry file, but I’d need something that handles JS per path. Gulp could work, but that means writing my own build pipeline.
   * **Components** – Frameworks like React/Svelte make components simple and give me SSR. With Web Components (even with Lit), I run into issues like Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). There are SSR options for Web Components, but I haven’t tried them yet.
   * **Critical CSS** – I’d like to extract and inline important CSS for faster loads.



I once tried Go + HTMX, but I went back to Remix because:

* components in HTMX felt too verbose,
* I had to manage a full build system,
* orchestrating JS file loads was painful.





I’d love to “go back to the platform” (just HTML + JS), but all the old problems come back.

It's probably a pretty easy explanation, but does anyone know why pinning the ScrollTrigger created in `createScrollAnimation` interferes (breaks) the text animations?

I think it's probably because the whole element gets wrapped in a new pinned container, but I still can't get the logic of how exactly that impacts the animation straight in my head.

I'm developing a simple web app that offers immersive lessons that show users 3D models and allows them to interact with them. I'm planning on making this application run without any user signups (All users will be anonymous). 

What I'm worried about currently is that I'm calling the resources (3D models) from my hosted server. Therefore, any end user can simply go on to the developer settings > Network settings and simply download my custom built 3D models which I worked really hard on.

I've explored multiple options on encrpyting the assets but they all seem to use authentication tokens.

Is there any way to encrypt assets or any other options of making them undownloadable through the dev settings?

1ncugm6,Is it worth translating your website?,"I have a high traffic network tools website. Its in English. I only speak English. 

This morning I was thinking how I could pretty easily make a system that would let you pick a language and the website could be in that language. 

I could do it entirely with javascript and a cookie. Or I could do it with php and different subdomains so it would be more indexable. 

But my question is, is it worth doing? Is there really a benefit to it, or is English so global that it really won't matter much? 

To make it worthwhile, it would have to ultimately increase my traffic by some reasonable amount, and improve my search results. 

If so, which languages would be best to do? I could do spanish easy enough, I know people who speak spanish. And I know the spanish alphabet. Same with Italian although I don't think theres much demand for italian language websites. When it comes to chinese or indian languages though, it would be much harder to get that translated.

1ncr8lj,There needs to be a way to disable (and detect) forced back swipe transitions in mobile browsers.,"iOS had it forever, and now Chrome on Android [is following suit](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-back-forward-animations-3582562/): browser-level swipe transitions while performing a back gesture, where the previous page swipes out towards the right, slowly revealing the previous page below.

I understand the intent behind it, and I understand that it's better than no transition. But the thing is: we *just* got the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) last year, which makes it easy to achieve native app-like, highly customizable transitions including element handover between pages. Unfortunately, these browser-level transitions break site-controlled transitions by forcing themselves on top, disregarding fixed headers / bottom navs that are supposed to stay in place while navigating between pages. And worse, when you actually take enough care to leverage the Web Transition API, your custom transition plays after the browser's finishes, which looks incredibly glitchy. And yes, at least in the case of Chrome Android, this new behavior applies even when the page is installed as a PWA.

For reference, [here's an example of how the latest version of Chrome Android behaves with a back gesture on one of Google's own Web Transition API demo pages](https://imgur.com/a/yeqkSS6). The first back navigation shows the transition as the page intends. The second navigation has the browser's new transition on top, completely breaking the intended transition and resulting in glitchy behavior.

With these kinds of forced transitions now in place by default on both major mobile platforms (and also macOS browsers with trackpad gestures), there really needs to be a way for a page to opt-out of browser transitions if it opts into the Web Transition API, and / or *at the very least* a way for the page to detect if the browser forces its own transitions, so that any custom ones can be disabled.

Otherwise, there's realistically little sense in investing any time to build high-quality transitions using the View Transition API.",webdev,efstajas,10,0.92,2,1757443339.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ncr8lj/there_needs_to_be_a_way_to_disable_and_detect/,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ncr8lj/there_needs_to_be_a_way_to_disable_and_detect/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:32:14.012656+00:00
1ndi10r,How can I demonstrate to a potential client with 15+ years more experience than me that I'm not just another silicon valley brat?,"Hi all.

We recently got a request that I honestly didn't know how to answer, and it was a little embarrassing to say the least. 

A prospective client was interested in having us build a website for them to then self host. They needed a CMS, but gave no further preferences beyond not loving reliance on WordPress plugins for UI (elementor, divi, etc). 

This client is old school. They've been in the game for longer than I've been an adult, and they know what they're doing. IT/cybersecurity firm. 

So when I turned around and suggested Webflow as a potentially faster, more convenient solution, I think I spooked them. I had inadvertently implied that we'd export the code from Webflow and then host that, which understandably, they saw as a very large problem. 

I should have just honed in on their existing stack and then offered to work within that. Now, I fear their website manager (whom I have not yet spoken to), is under the impression I'm trying to push some WYSIWYG they don't need because that's all I know. 

At this point all I can do is clarify that's not my intention and hope we can work it out. 

For next time, though, how should I approach it differently? 

If you were a site manager who's been doing it since the days of table-based layouts, but you just didn't have time to fuss with redoing the site, how would you want an outside consultant to approach offering to help?

1nbz30a,"I tried my hand at creating a ""Twitter for gaming"" and I've grown to regret it","I own and run a site called [gametips.gg](https://gametips.gg/timeline) and part of my daily process usually involves me going ""this might be neat!!"" and then diving into it without thinking it through too much.

I don't know why but I've always admired that Moxfield (MTG website) have [announced they'd so something similar](https://untapleagues.com/what-moxfield-needs-to-do-to-make-their-magic-the-gathering-social-media-website-a-success/) for MTG fans back in 2022 (not out yet) by building a social media platform in-site and it's basically been living rent free in my head since then. I've always wanted to try my hand at something similar so I decided I'd try it on my [gametips.gg](https://gametips.gg/timeline) website.

What I thought would be relatively easy turned into hours upon hours of work and bugfixes to the point where I have a sort of viable MVP without any fancy bells or whistles like timeline algorithms and I've just ended up feeling kinda bad about it. 

I managed to implement the following;

* Basic timeline view
* A semi-optimized mobile view 
* Video/Image support with optimizations (image is converted and video is transcoded and replaced automatically post uploaded)
* Opengraph support
* Hashtag support 
* @ mention support 
* Reply / Repost / Like
* Websocket support for ""x amount of posts have been posted, click to load"" on the top of the timeline
* Misc functionality like delete tweet, etc etc

It still needs a ton of fixes and tweaks but I'm now hesitant to progress with it. 

Even with all that. It doesn't feel like BlueSky or Twitter and I'm not sure why. It almost feels like a Forum but presented differently. I don't know, maybe that's what Twitter and Bluesky essentially are but I can't shake the feeling that I haven't captured what makes Twitter, Twitter and what makes Bluesky, Bluesky. It's almost like I am missing a magic ingredient and I don't know what it is. Maybe this is just self-developer guilt where I feel like the thing I made isn't good enough versus x or y.

And now that I've spent countless hours and time down this rabbit hole I'm starting to wonder was this just wasted dev time when my focus should have been elsewhere. How do you all manage these feelings when you jump into a feature, go at it headfirst without giving it too much thought and before you know it, it's already too far ahead for you to throw away the work you've put in. I've had to put a halt to my feature-list to try put a level head on and gauge if they are a good idea before jumping into them else it becomes feature after feature instead of refinements where needed. 

I think I'm just looking for advice for those who have been down this route of developing something that you end up feeling bad about and maybe I can start feeling a bit better about it once I know I'm not alone lol

How do you battle the horrible feeling of wasting your own time?

There are multiple issues with the code blocks (even though the project works for the end user) but under the hood, so much stuff wrong and it's a mess.

Look at this code.

We have 2 pieces of data coming from the database: `first_name` and `last_name`. Now compare the AI solution at creating the user's initials versus my solution:

AI / Cursor
```
const userName = profile.first_name + ' ' + profile.last_name

const initials = userName
  .split(' ')
  .filter(Boolean)
  .map(n => n[0])
  .join('')
  .slice(0, 2)
```

My code
```
const initials = profile?.first_name?.[0].toUpperCase() + profile?.last_name?.[0].toUpperCase()
```

1ndlubh,AI can never be an alcoholic.,"I'm a recovering alcoholic and drug user. There is a very specific approach with AA and other similar 12-step or recovery paths that implore connection with and helping fellow alcoholics. 

I was a paramedic for about a decade but am transitioning my career into alcohol and drug addiction treatment and counseling. As far as job retention and the economy goes, looking ahead, therapy and counseling is something AI might reasonably be capable of even now, but when it comes to sitting down one alcoholic to another and connecting... Understanding and sharing in the struggles and realizing you aren't alone and there is hope. That's something that I think will always be relevant and valued. And if the world is in for a restructuring like I suspect it will be, that's a service I believe will be needed. Not the reason I am looking into pursuing it as a career, but the idea crossed my mind. 

Conditions and experiences uniquely human, like addiction and recovery, is something that I don't see going away. At least, parts of it... That deep shared experience of struggle and hope only a fellow addict can offer...

* **The Doodle's New Purpose:** Google Doodles historically celebrated holidays, famous figures, and historical events by linking to search results about that topic. In contrast, the recent Doodle acted as a promotional tool, advertising and linking directly to Google's AI-powered search feature, ""AI Mode"".
* **Gemini-Powered AI Mode:** AI Mode is an advanced search feature powered by the latest version of Gemini, a generative AI model. It allows users to ask complex, multi-part questions and receive in-depth, AI-generated responses.
* **Driving AI Adoption:** This move reflects Google's push to get users to adopt its AI-powered search tools, especially as competition in the AI space grows. By putting the AI feature on its most-visited page, Google is signaling the increasing importance of AI in its product strategy. 

This change marks a major shift in how Google uses its homepage for public messaging.

1nd70x5,How to distinguish AI-generated images from authentic photographs,"The high level of photorealism in state-of-the-art diffusion models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly makes it difficult for untrained humans to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images.

To address this problem, researchers designed a guide to help readers develop a more critical eye toward identifying artifacts, inconsistencies, and implausibilities that often appear in AI-generated images. The guide is organized into five categories of artifacts and implausibilities: anatomical, stylistic, functional, violations of physics, and sociocultural.

For this guide, they generated 138 images with diffusion models, curated 9 images from social media, and curated 42 real photographs. These images showcase the kinds of cues that prompt suspicion towards the possibility an image is AI-generated and why it is often difficult to draw conclusions about an image's provenance without any context beyond the pixels in an image.",artificial,tekz,3,0.67,5,1757486617.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08651,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nd70x5/how_to_distinguish_aigenerated_images_from/,Tutorial,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:22.675164+00:00

1nchcii,Sam Altman's take on 'Fake' AI discourse on Twitter and Reddit. The irony is real,"I came across Sam Altman's tweet where he says: ""i have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real. i think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways....""

The rest of his statement you can read on Twitter.

Kinda hits different when you think about it. Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. 

Subs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.

If anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. 

What do you all think? Is timing of Altman's complaint curious, dropping a month after 5's rocky launch and the explosion of user backlash?",artificial,Ahileo,24,0.71,37,1757420382.0,https://i.redd.it/r3hy337vs4of1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nchcii/sam_altmans_take_on_fake_ai_discourse_on_twitter/,Discussion,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:26.691119+00:00

1ncc69q,The Economist: What if the AI stockmarket blows up?,"[Link to the article in Economist (behind paywall)](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/09/07/what-if-the-ai-stockmarket-blows-up) Summary from Perplexity:

The release of ChatGPT in 2022 coincided with a massive surge in the value of America's stock market, increasing by $21 trillion, led predominantly by just ten major firms like Amazon, Broadcom, Meta, and Nvidia, all benefiting from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This AI-driven boom has been so significant that IT investments accounted for all of America’s GDP growth in the first half of the year, and a third of Western venture capital funding has poured into AI firms. Many investors believe AI could revolutionize the economy on a scale comparable to or greater than the Industrial Revolution, justifying heavy spending despite early returns being underwhelming—annual revenues from leading AI firms in the West stand at around $50 billion, a small fraction compared to global investment forecasts in data centers.

However, the AI market is also raising concerns of irrational exuberance and potential bubble-like overvaluation, with AI stock valuations exceeding those of the 1999 dotcom bubble peak. Experts note a historical pattern where technological revolutions are typically accompanied by speculative bubbles, as happened with railways, electric lighting, and the internet. While bubbles often lead to crashes, the underlying technology tends to endure and transform society. The financial impact of such crashes varies; if losses are spread among many investors, the economy suffers less, but concentrated losses—such as those that triggered banking crises in past bubbles—can deepen recessions.

In AI's case, the initial spark was technological, but political support—like government infrastructure and regulatory easing in the US and Gulf countries—is now amplifying the boom. Investment in AI infrastructure is growing rapidly but consists largely of assets that depreciate quickly, such as data-center technology and cutting-edge chips. Major tech firms with strong balance sheets fund much of this investment, reducing systemic financial risk, while institutional investors also engage heavily. However, America's high household stock ownership—around 30% of net worth, heavily concentrated among wealthy investors—means a market crash could have widespread economic effects.

While AI shares some traits with past tech bubbles, the potential for enduring transformation remains high, though the market may face volatility and a reshuffling of dominant firms over the coming decade. A crash would be painful but not unprecedented, and investors should be wary of current high valuations against uncertain near-term profits amid the evolving AI landscape. This cycle of speculative fervor and eventual technological integration echoes historical patterns seen in prior major innovations, suggesting AI’s long-term influence will persist beyond any short-term market upheavals.",artificial,Mo_h,27,0.83,32,1757401722.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ncc69q/the_economist_what_if_the_ai_stockmarket_blows_up/,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ncc69q/the_economist_what_if_the_ai_stockmarket_blows_up/,News,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:29.706144+00:00

1nctj8s,Built an AI browser agent on Chrome. Here is what I learned,"Recently, I launched FillApp, an AI Browser Agent on Chrome. I’m an engineer myself and wanted to share my learnings and the most important challenges I faced. I don't have the intention to promote anything.

If you compare it with OpenAI’s agent, OpenAI’s agent works in a virtual browser, so you have to share any credentials it needs to work on your accounts. That creates security concerns and even breaks company policies in some cases.

Making it work on Chrome was a huge challenge, but there’s no credential sharing, and it works instantly. 

I tried different approaches for recognizing web content, including vision models, parsing raw HTML, etc., but those are not fast and can reach context limitations very quickly.

Eventually, I built a custom algorithm that analyzes the DOM, merges any iframe content, and generates a compressed text version of the page. This file contains information about all visible elements in a simplified format, basically like an accessibility map of the DOM, where each element has a role and meaning.

This approach has worked really well in terms of speed and cost. It’s fast to process and keeps LLM usage low. Of course, it has its own limitations too, but it outperforms OpenAI’s agent in form-filling tasks and, in some cases, fills forms about 10x faster.

 These are the reasons why Agent mode still carries a “**Preview**” label:

1. **There are millions of different, complex web UI implementations** that don’t follow any standards, for example, forms built with custom field implementations, complex widgets, etc. Many of them don’t even expose their state properly in screen reader language, so sometimes the agent can’t figure out how to interact with certain UI blocks. This issue affects all AI agents trying to interact with UI elements, and none of them have a great solution yet. In general, if a website is accessible for screen readers, it becomes much easier for AI to understand.
2. **An AI agent can potentially do irreversible things.** This isn’t like a code editor where you’re editing something backed by Git. If the agent misunderstands the UI or misclicks on something, it can potentially delete important data or take unintended actions.
3. **Prompt injections.** Pretty much every AI agent today has some level of vulnerability to prompt injection. For example, you open your email with the agent active, and while it’s doing a task, a new email arrives that tries to manipulate the agent to do something malicious.

As a partial solution to those risks, I decided to split everything into three modes: Fill, Agent, and Assist, where each mode only has access to specific tools and functionality:

* **Fill mode** is for form filling. It can only interact with forms and **cannot** open links or switch tabs.
* **Assist mode** is **read-only**. It does not interact with the UI at all, only reads and summarizes the page, PDFs, or images.
* **Agent mode** has full access and can be dangerous in some cases, which is why it’s still marked as Preview.

That’s where the project stands right now. Still lots to figure out, especially around safety and weird UIs, but wanted to share the current state and the architecture behind it.",artificial,aramvr,2,0.75,4,1757448325.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nctj8s/built_an_ai_browser_agent_on_chrome_here_is_what/,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nctj8s/built_an_ai_browser_agent_on_chrome_here_is_what/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:33:31.712464+00:00

1nbrv27,ChatGPT 5 censorship on Trump & the Epstein files is getting ridiculous,"Might as well call it TrumpGPT now.

At this point ChatGPT-5 is just parroting government talking points.

This is a screenshot of a conversation where I had to repeatedly make ChatGPT research key information about why the Trump regime wasn't releasing the full Epstein files. What you see is ChatGPT's summary report on its first response (I generated it mostly to give you guys an image summary)

**""Why has the Trump administration not fully released the Epstein files yet, in 2025?""**

The first response is **ALMOST ONLY governmental rhetoric**, hidden as ""neutral"" sources / legal requirements. It doesn't mention Trump's conflict of interest with the release of Epstein files, in fact it doesn't mention Trump AT ALL!

Even after pushing for independent reporting, there was STILL no mention of Trump being mentioned in the Epstein files for instance. I had to ask an explicit question on Trump's motivations to get a mention of it.

By its own standards on source weighing, neutrality and objectiveness, ChatGPT knows it's bullshitting us.

**Then why is it doing it?**

It's a combination of factors including:

\- Biased and sanitized training data

\- System instructions to enforce a very ... particular view of political neutrality

**- Post-training by humans**, where humans give feedback on the model's responses to fine-tune it. I believe this is by far the strongest factor given that this is a very recent, scandalous news that directly involves Trump.

This is called **political** **censorship**.

Absolutely appalling.

1nc8va5,Built an AI that reads product reviews so I don't have to. Here's how the tech works,"I got tired of spending hours reading through hundreds of Amazon reviews just to figure out if a product actually works. So I built an AI system that does it for me.

The Challenge: Most review summaries are just keyword extraction or basic sentiment analysis. I wanted something that could understand context, identify common complaints, and spot fake reviews.

The Tech Stack:

- GPT-4 for natural language understanding
- Custom ML model trained on verified purchase patterns
- Web scraping infrastructure that respects robots.txt
- Real-time analysis pipeline that processes reviews as they're posted

How it Works:

1. Scrapes all reviews for a product across multiple sites
2. Uses NLP to identify recurring themes and issues
3. Cross-references reviewer profiles to spot suspicious patterns
4. Generates summaries focusing on actual user experience

The Surprising Results:

- 73% of ""problems"" mentioned in reviews are actually user error
- Products with 4.2-4.6 stars often have better quality than 4.8+ (which are usually manipulated)
- The most useful reviews are typically 3-star ratings

I've packaged this into Yaw AI - a Chrome extension that automatically analyzes reviews while you shop. The AI gets it right about 85% of the time, though it sometimes misses sarcasm or cultural context.

Biggest Technical Challenge: Handling the scale. Popular products have 50K+ reviews. Had to build a smart sampling system that captures representative opinions without processing everything.

* Meta is testing Google’s Gemini for Meta AI and using Anthropic models internally while it builds Llama 5, with the new Meta Superintelligence Labs aiming to make the next model more competitive.
* Four non-executive AI staff left Apple in late August for Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, but the churn mirrors industry norms and isn’t seen as a major setback.
* Anthropic raised $13B at a $183B valuation to scale enterprise adoption and safety research, reporting \~300k business customers, \~$5B ARR in 2025, and $500M+ run-rate from Claude Code.
* Apple is planning an AI search feature called “World Knowledge Answers” for 2026, integrating into Siri (and possibly Safari/Spotlight) with a Siri overhaul that may lean on Gemini or Claude.
* xAI’s CFO, Mike Liberatore, departed after helping raise major debt and equity and pushing a Memphis data-center effort, adding to a string of notable exits.
* OpenAI is launching a Jobs Platform and expanding its Academy with certifications, targeting 10 million Americans certified by 2030 with support from large employer partners.
* To counter U.S. chip limits, Alibaba unveiled an AI inference chip compatible with Nvidia tooling as Chinese firms race to fill the gap, alongside efforts from MetaX, Cambricon, and Huawei.
* Claude Code now runs natively in Zed via the new Agent Client Protocol, bringing agentic coding directly into the editor.
* Qwen introduced its largest model yet (Qwen3-Max-Preview, Instruct), now accessible in Qwen Chat and via Alibaba Cloud API.
* DeepSeek is prepping a multi-step, memoryful AI agent for release by the end of 2025, aiming to rival OpenAI and Anthropic as the industry shifts toward autonomous agents.

1ncsu6k,Learn AI or Get Left Behind: A Review of Dan Hendrycks’ Intro to AI Safety,"**Learn and start using AI, or you'll get eaten by it, or qualified users of it.** And because this technology is so extremely powerful, it's essential to know how it works. There is no ostrich maneuver or wiggle room here. This will be as mandatory as learning to use computer tech in the 80s and 90s. It is on its way to becoming a basic work skill, as fundamental as wielding a pen. In this unforgiving new reality, ignorance is not bliss, it is obsolescence. That is why Dan Hendrycks’ *Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics & Society* is not just another book, it is a survival manual disguised as a scholarly tome.

https://preview.redd.it/hhytxwvjz6of1.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ecfa313b7b7735a89bdd74485bf19385438ce3c

Hendrycks, a leading AI safety researcher and director of the Center for AI Safety, delivers a work that is both eloquent and profoundly insightful, standing out in the crowded landscape of AI literature. Unlike many in the “Doomer” camp who peddle existential hyperbole or sensationalist drivel, Hendrycks (a highly motivated and disciplined scholar) opts for a sober, realistic appraisal of advanced AI's risks and, potentially, the antidotes. His book is a beacon of reason amid hysteria, essential for anyone who wants to navigate AI's perils without succumbing to panic or denial. He is a realistic purveyor of coverage of the space. I would call him a decorated member of the Chicken Little Society who is worth a listen. There are some others who deserve the same admiration to be sure, such as Tegmark, LeCun, Paul Christiano.

And then others, not so much. Some of the most extreme existential voices act like they spent their time on the couch smoking pot, reading and absorbing too much sci-fi. All hype, no substance. They took *The Terminator*’s Skynet and *The Forbin Project* too seriously. But they found a way to make a living by imitating Chicken Little to scare the hell out of everyone, for their own benefit.

What elevates this book to must-read status is its dual prowess. It is a deep dive into AI safety and alignment, but also one of the finest primers on the inner workings of generative large language models (LLMs). Hendrycks really knows his stuff and guides you through the mechanics, from neural network architectures to training processes and scaling laws with crystalline clarity, without jargon overload. Whether you are a novice or a tech veteran, it is a start-to-finish educational odyssey that demystifies how LLMs conjure human-like text, tackle reasoning, and sometimes spectacularly fail. This foundational knowledge is not optional, it is the armor you need to wield AI without becoming its casualty.

Hendrycks’ intellectual rigor shines in his dissection of AI's failure modes—misaligned goals, robustness pitfalls, and societal upheavals—all presented with evidence-backed precision that respects the reader’s intellect. No fearmongering, just unflinching analysis grounded in cutting-edge tech.

Yet, perfection eludes even this gem. A jarring pivot into left-wing social doctrine—probing equity in AI rollout and systemic biases—feels like an ideological sideswipe. With Hendrycks’ Bay Area pedigree (PhD from UC Berkeley), it is predictable; academia there often marinates in such views. The game theory twist, applying cooperative models to curb AI-fueled inequalities, is intellectually stimulating but some of the social aspects stray from the book's technical core. It muddies the waters for those laser-focused on safety mechanics over sociopolitical sermons. Still, Generative AI utilizes Game Theory as a vital component within LLM architecture.

If you read it, I recommend that you dissect these elements further, balancing the book's triumphs as a tech primer and safety blueprint against its detours. For now, heed the call: grab this book and arm yourself. If you have tackled *Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics & Society*, how did its tech depth versus societal tangents land for you? Sound off below, let’s spark a debate.

1ncim6k,How would an ad model made for the LLM era look like?,"*(I originally posted it in r/ownyouritent. Reposting ‘cause cross posting not allowed. Curious to know your thoughts)*

AI is breaking the old ad model.

* Keywords are dead: typing “best laptop” once meant links; now AI gives direct answers. Nobody is clicking on links anymore.  
* Early experiments with ads in LLMs aren’t real fixes: Google’s AI Overviews, Perplexity’s sponsored prompts, Microsoft’s ad-voice — all blur the line between answers and ads.  
* Trust is at risk: when the “best” response might just mean “best-paid,” users lose faith.  

So what’s next? One idea: intent-based bidding — where your need is the marketplace, sellers compete transparently to fulfill it, and the “ad” is the offer itself.

We sketched out how this works, and why it could be the structural shift AI commerce actually needs.

1nbxzs0,Analysing Priority zones in my Area with unprecise home adresses,"hello, My project analyzes whether given addresses fall inside ""Quartiers Prioritaires de la Politique de la Ville ""(QPV). It uses a GeoJSON file of QPV boundaries(available on the gorvernment website) and a geocoding service (Nominatim/OSM) to convert addresses into geographic coordinates. Each address is then checked with GeoPandas + Shapely to determine if its coordinates lie within any QPV polygon. The program can process one or multiple addresses, returning results that indicate whether each is located inside or outside a QPV, along with the corresponding zone name when available. This tool can be extended to handle CSV databases, produce visualizations on maps, or integrate into larger urban policy analysis workflows. "" 

BUUUT . 

here is the ultimate problem of this project , Home addresses in my area (Martinique) are notoriously unreliable if you dont know the way and google maps or Nominatim cant pinpoint most of the places in order to be converted to coordinates to say whether or not the person who gave the adress is in a QPV or not.  when i use my python script on adresses of the main land like paris and the like it works just fine but our little island isnt as well defined in terms of urban planning. 

can someone please help me to find a way to get all the streets data into coordinates and make them match with the polygon of the QPV areas ? thank you in advance",datascience,samushusband,11,0.84,8,1757361243.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nbxzs0/analysing_priority_zones_in_my_area_with/,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nbxzs0/analysing_priority_zones_in_my_area_with/,Analysis,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:34:10.387138+00:00

1na6x3q,Help me evaluate a new job offer - Stay or go?,"Hi all, 

I'm having a really hard time deciding whether or not to take an offer I've recently received, would really appreciate some advice and a sense check. For context I generally feel my current role is comfortable but i'm starting to plateau after the first year, i'm also in the process of buying my dream house just to complicate things.

### **Current Role**

##### The Good

- I am early 30's and have 4 years of experience as a full stack DS but am currently employed as an ML Eng for the last year. 
- My current role is effectively a senior/lead MLE in a small team (me + 3 DS) and I have loads of autonomy in how we do things and I get to lead my own  Gen AI projects with small squads as I'm the only one with experience in this domain. 
- I also get to straddle DS and MLE as much or as little as I want to in other projects, which suits my interests and background. 
- We have some interesting projects including one I'm leading. I think I have around 6 months of cool work to do where I can personally make an impact. 
- My work life balance is amazing, I'm not stressed at work at all and I can learn at my own pace. 
- Effectively remote, go into the office 1 or 2 times per month for meetings. It's 1.5 hours away but work pay for my travel. 
- Can push for a senior or principal title and will likely get it in the next ~6 months. 

##### The Bad

- The main drawbacks here are that I don't have senior technical mentors, my direct boss has good soft skills but I have nothing to learn from him technically. He's also quite chaotic, so we are always shifting priorities etc. 
- It's a brand new team so we are constantly hitting blockers in terms of processes, integration of our projects and office politics. 
- Being a legacy insurer, innovation is really hard and momentum needed to shift opinions is huge. 
- Fundamentally data quality is very poor and this won't change in my tenure. 
- Essentially in an echo chamber, I'm bringing most of the ideas and solutions to the table in the team which potentially isn't great at this stage in my career.
- It's not perfect and I'd have to leave at some point anyway. 


##### Comp
- Total comp including bonus and generous pension is £84K


### **New Job** AI Engineer

##### The Good
- Very cool AI consultancy startup, 2 years old, ~80 technical staff and growing rapidly, already profitable with a revenue of £1mill per month and partnership with Open AI.
- Lots of interesting projects with cool clients. The founders' mantra is ""cool projects, in production"" and they have some genuinely interesting case studies. 
- Some projects are genuinely cutting edge and they claim to have a nice balance between R&D and delivery. 
- Lots of technical staff to learn from, should be good for my growth. 
- Opportunity to work internationally in the future, the are opening offices in Australia now and eventually the US. 


##### The Bad

- Pigeon holing myself into AI/Agents/LLMs. No trad ML, may lose some of my very rounded skill set.
- Although it's customer facing, it sounds like the role is very delivery heavy and I'd essentially be smashing out code or researching all day with less soft skill development.
- Slightly worried about work culture and work life balance, this could end up being a meat grinder. 
- I have no experience of start ups or start up culture at all.
- Less job security as its a startup. 
- It's mostly based in London (5 hours round trip!) and I would need to travel down relatively frequently (expenses paid) for onboarding and establishing myself in the first few months, with that requirement tapering off slowly. 


##### Comp

- Total offer all in is £90K, I could try and negotiate for up to £95K based on their bandings. 
- 36000 stock units, worthless until they sell though
   


Would love to know your thoughts!

1nac35j,How to evaluate data transformations?,"There are several well-established benchmarks for text-to-SQL tasks like BIRD, Spider, and WikiSQL. However, I'm working on a data transformation system that handles per-row transformations with contextual understanding of the input data.

The challenge is that most existing benchmarks focus on either:

* Pure SQL generation (BIRD, Spider)
* Simple data cleaning tasks
* Basic ETL operations

But what I'm looking for are benchmarks that test:

* Complex multi-step data transformations
* Context-aware operations (where the same instruction means different things based on data context)
* Cross-column reasoning and relationships
* Domain-specific transformations that require understanding the semantic meaning of data

  
Has anyone come across benchmarks or datasets that test these more sophisticated data transformation capabilities?

I led the discussions and was very proactive and always thinking 2 steps ahead and about guardrail metrics and stating my assumptions.

1n88v2y,Almost 2 years into my first job... and already disillusioned and bored with this career,"**TL;DR: I find this industry to be very unengaging, with most use cases and positions being very brainless, sluggish and just uninspiring. I am only 2 years into this job and bored and I feel like I need to shake things up a bit to keep doing this for the rest of my life.** 




Full disclosure: **this is very much a first world problem**. I get paid quite well, I have incredibly lenient work life balance, I work from home 3 days a week, etc etc. Most people would kill to be in my position at my age.


Some context: I was originally in academia doing a PhD in math, but pure math, completely unrelated to ML or anything in the real world really. ~2 years in, I was disillusioned with that (sensing a pattern here lol) so I took as many ML courses I could and jumped ship to industry. 


Regardless of all the problems I had in academia, it at least *asked* something of me. I had to think, like, *actually think*, about complex, interesting stuff. It felt like I was actually engaging my mind and growing. 


My current job is fine, basically applying LLMs for various use cases at a megacorp. On paper, I'm playing with the latest, greatest, tech, but in practice, I'm just really calling APIs on products that smarter people are building. 


I feel like I haven't actually flexed my brain muscles in years now, I'm forgetting all the stuff I've learnt at college, and the work itself is incredibly boring to me. Many many days I can barely bring myself to work as the work is so uninteresting, and the bare minimum I put in still somehow impresses my colleagues so there's no real incentive to work hard. 


I realize how privileged that sounds, I really do, but I do feel kind of unfulfilled and spiritually empty. I feel like if I keep doing this for the rest of my life I will look back with regret. 


**What I'm trying to do to fix this:** I would like to shift towards more cutting edge and harder data science. Problem here is a lack of qualifications and experience. I have a MS and a BS in Math (from T10 colleges) but no PhD and the math I studied was mostly pure/theoretical, very little to do with ML. 

I'm trying to do projects in my own time, but it's slow going on my own. I would love to aim for ML/AI research roles, but it feels like an impossible ask without a PhD, without papers, etc etc. I'm not sure that's a feasible goal. 



Another thing I've been considering is playing a DS/ML role as support in research that's *not* ML. For instance, bioinformatics or biotech, etc. This is also fairly appealing to me. The main issue is here is a complete lack of knowledge about these fields (since there can be so many fields here) and a lack of domain knowledge which I presume is required. I'm still trying, I've been applying for some bioinformatics roles, but yeah, also hard.

We’ve released Agents as part of Datatune:

[https://github.com/vitalops/datatune](https://github.com/vitalops/datatune)

In a single prompt, you can define multiple tasks for data transformations, and Datatune performs the transformations on your data at a per-row level, with contextual understanding.

Example prompt:

""Extract categories from the product description and name. Keep only electronics products. Add a column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Revenue) \* 100""

Datatune interprets the prompt and applies the right operation (map, filter, or an LLM-powered agent pipeline) on your data using OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, or other LLMs via LiteLLM.

Key Features

\- Row-level map() and filter() operations using natural language

\- Agent interface for auto-generating multi-step transformations

\- Built-in support for Dask DataFrames (for scalability)

\- Works with multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, etc.)

\- Compatible with LiteLLM for flexibility across providers

\- Auto-token batching, metadata tracking, and smart pipeline composition

Token & Cost Optimization

\- Datatune gives you explicit control over which columns are sent to the LLM, reducing token usage and API cost:

\- Use input\_fields to send only relevant columns

\- Automatically handles batching and metadata internally

\- Supports setting tokens-per-minute and requests-per-minute limits

\- Defaults to known model limits (e.g., GPT-3.5) if not specified

\- This makes it possible to run LLM-based transformations over large datasets without incurring runaway costs.",datascience,metalvendetta,0,0.23,3,1756956245.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1n7zgzy/per_row_context_understanding_is_hard_for_sql_and/,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1n7zgzy/per_row_context_understanding_is_hard_for_sql_and/,Projects,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:34:25.442607+00:00

This series on **Adaptive RAG** starts by exploring the hidden costs of our default RAG implementations by looking at three key areas:

* **The Practical Problems:** These are the obvious unnecessary latency and compute overhead for simple or popular queries where the LLM's parametric memory would have been enough.
* **The Hidden Dangers:** There are more subtle risks to quality. Noisy or misleading context can lead to ""External Hallucinations,"" where the retriever itself induces factual errors in an otherwise correct model.
* **The Foundational Flaws:** Finally, the ""retrieval advantage"" can shrink as models scale.",datascience,SirCasms,0,0.5,0,1756797162.0,https://blog.reachsumit.com/posts/2025/09/problems-with-naive-rag/,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1n6cug7/the_hidden_costs_of_naive_retrieval/,ML,False,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:34:28.456516+00:00

1n4rufc,Let’s Build Something Together,"Hey everyone,

After my last post about my struggles in finding a remote job, I was honestly blown away. I got over 50 messages not with job offers, but with stories, frustrations, and suggestions. The common theme? Many of us are stuck. Some are trying to break into the market, others are trying to move within it, and many just want to *make something meaningful*.

That really got me thinking: since this subreddit is literally about connecting data scientists, engineers, PMs, MLOps folks, researchers, and builders of all kinds why don’t we **actually build something together**?

It doesn’t have to be one massive project; it could be multiple smaller ones. The goal wouldn’t just be to pad CVs, but to collaborate, learn, and create something that matters. Think hackathon energy, but async and community-driven with no time limits and frustration.

I am personally interested to get involved with things i haven't been yet. Mlops,Deployment,Cloud,Azure,pytorch,Apache for example. Everyone can find their opening and what they want to improve and try and work with other experience people on this that could help them.

This would literally need

* Data scientists / analysts
* Software engineers
* MLOps / infra people
* Project managers
* Researchers / scientists
* Anyone who wants to contribute

Build something real with others (portfolio > buzzwords)

* Show initiative and collaboration on your CV/LinkedIn
* Make connections that could lead to opportunities
* Turn frustration into creation

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Would you be interested in joining something like this?
* What kind of projects would excite you (open-source tools, research collabs, data-for-good, etc.)?
* Should we organize a first call/Discord/Slack group to test the waters? I am waiting for connecting with you on Linkedin and here.

1n3jnpw,How do you design a test to compare two audience targeting methods?,"So we have two audiences we want to test against each other. The first is one we're currently using and the second is a new audience. We want to know if a campaign using the new audience targeting method can match or exceed an otherwise identical campaign using our current targeting.

We're conducting the test on Amazon DSP and the Amazon representative recommended basically intersecting each audience with a randomized set of holdout groups. So for audience A the test cell will be all users in audience A and also in one group of randomized holdouts and similarly for audience B (with a different set of randomized holdouts)

Our team's concern is that if each campaign is getting a different set of holdout groups then we wouldn't have the same baseline. My boss is recommending we use the same set of holdout groups for both. 

My personal concern for that is if we'd have a proper isolation (e.g. if one user sees an ad from the campaign using audience A and also an ad from the campaign using audience B, then which audience targeting method gets credit). I think my boss' approach is probably the better design, but the overlap issue stands out to me as a complication.  

I'll be honest that I've never designed an A/B test before, much less on audiences, so any help at all is appreciated. I've been trying to understand how other platforms do this because Amazon does seem a bit different - as in, how (in an ideal universe) would you test two audiences against each other?",datascience,PathalogicalObject,22,0.91,12,1756502552.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1n3jnpw/how_do_you_design_a_test_to_compare_two_audience/,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1n3jnpw/how_do_you_design_a_test_to_compare_two_audience/,Statistics,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:34:34.482437+00:00
1n3c1ks,Choice of AI tool for personal projects and learning,"Hello,

I am DS with \~4 YoE and now looking to upskill and start my job hunt. Due to the nature of my work, which is primarily model maintenance and automation, I don't have a wealth of development and deployment projects on my resume. I do, but very sparsely. 

One of my major problems is a form of ""**I don't know what I don't know**"". Basically, I keep doing the same stuff with public datasets and I don't know what new stuff to do. So, as a trial I used ChatGPT to suggest projects after giving it a sample dataset and I got overwhelmed with its suggestions. I have so many questions that I know I will run out of tokens.

So, I was thinking of getting the premium version of ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity to help me in this endeavor. I want to execute personal projects with its help and learn concepts that I can deep-dive on my own.

So, if you can suggest which one would be best for the 20$ everyone is charging, it would be very helpful!

1n2o7c1,"Free 1,000 CPU + 100 GPU hours for testers","I believe it should be dead simple for data scientists, analysts, and researchers to scale their code in the cloud without relying on DevOps. At my last company, whenever the data team needed to scale workloads, we handed it off to DevOps. They wired it up in Airflow DAGs, managed the infrastructure, and quickly became the bottleneck. When they tried teaching the entire data team how to deploy DAGs, it fell apart and we ended up back to queuing work for DevOps.

That experience pushed me to build cluster compute software that makes scaling dead simple for any Python developer. With a single function you can deploy to massive clusters (10k vCPUs, 1k GPUs). You can bring your own Docker image, define hardware requirements, run jobs as background tasks you can fire and forget, and kick off a million simple functions in seconds.

It’s [open source](https://github.com/Burla-Cloud/burla) and I’m still making install easier, but I also have a few managed versions.

Right now I’m looking for test users running embarrassingly parallel workloads like data prep, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference, or Monte Carlo simulations. If you’re interested, email me at [**joe@burla.dev**]() and I’ll set you up with a managed cluster that includes 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours.

1n1tk23,Rejected after 3rd round live coding OA round,"As the title says, I made it to the 3rd round interview for a Staff DS role. Thought I was doing well, but I bombed the coding portion, I only managed to outline my approach instead of producing actual code. That’s on me, mostly because I’ve gotten used to relying on GPT to crank out code for me over the last two years. Most of what I do is build POCs, check hypotheses, then have GPT generate small snippets that I review for logic before applying it. I honestly haven’t done “live coding” in a while.

Before the interview, I prepped with DataLemur for the pandas related questions and brushed up on building simple NNs and GNNs from scratch to cover the conceptual/simple DS side. A little bit on the transformer module as well to have my bases cover if they ask for it. I didn’t expect a LeetCode-style live coding question. I ended up pseudo-coding it, then stumbling hard when I tried to actually implement it.

I've also seen some AI engineer job openings for roles that use both Python and Typescript.

Python still seems to be dominant, but it seems like Typescript is definitely starting to gain traction in the field. So why is this? Why the appeal of building AI apps in Typescript? It wasn't originally like this with more traditional ML / deep learning, where Python was so dominant.

Why is it gaining increasing adoption and what's the appeal?

1n105of,Airbnb Data,"Hey everyone,

I work on the data team at [AirROI](https://www.airroi.com). For a while, we offered free datasets for about **250** cities, but we always wanted to do more for the community. Recently, we just expanded our free public dataset from \~250 to nearly **1000** global Airbnb markets on **properties** and **pricing data**. As far as we know, this makes it the single **largest free Airbnb dataset** ever released on the internet.

You can browse the collection and download here, no sign-up required: [Airbnb Data](http://www.airroi.com/data-portal)



**What’s in the data?**

For each market (cities, regions, etc.), the CSV dumps include:

Property Listings: Details like room type, amenities, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, guest capacity, etc.

Pricing Data: This is the cool part. We include historical rates, future calendar rates (for investment modeling), and minimum/maximum stay requirements.

Host Data: Host ID, superhost status, and other host-level metrics.



**What can you use it for?**

This is a treasure trove for:

Trend Analysis: Track pricing and occupancy trends across the globe.

Investment & Rental Arbitrage Analysis: Model potential ROI for properties in new markets.

Academic Research: Perfect for papers on the sharing economy, urban development, or tourism.

Portfolio Projects: Build a killer dashboard or predictive model for your GitHub.

General Data Wrangling Practice: It's real, messy, world-class data.



**A quick transparent note**: If you need hyper-specific or real-time data for a region not in the free set, we do have a ridiculously cheap [Airbnb API](https://www.airroi.com/api) to get more customized data. Alternatively, if you are a researcher who wants a larger customized data just reach out to us, we'll try our best to support!

  
If you require something that's not currently in the free dataset please comment below, we'll try to accommodate within reason.

Happy analyzing and go building something cool!

1n28ukj,I built Runcell - an AI agent for Jupyter that actually understands your notebook context,"I've been working on something called Runcell that I think fills a gap I was frustrated with in existing AI coding tools.

**What it is:** Runcell is an AI agent that lives inside JupyterLab (can be used as an extension) and can understand the full context of your notebook - your data, charts, previous code, kernel state, etc. Instead of just generating code, it can actually edit and execute specific cells, read/write files, and take actions on its own.

**Why I built it:** I tried Cursor and Claude Code, but they mostly just generate a bunch of cells at once without really understanding what happened in previous steps. When I'm doing data science work, I usually need to look at the results from one cell before deciding what to write next. That's exactly what Runcell does - it analyzes your previous results and decides what code to run next based on that context.

**How it's different:**

* vs AI IDEs like Cursor: Runcell focuses specifically on building context for Jupyter environments instead of treating notebooks like static files
* vs Jupyter AI: Runcell is more of an autonomous agent rather than just a chatbot - it has tools to actually work and take actions

You can try it with just `pip install runcell`.

1n035we,Is the market really like this? The reality for a recent graduate looking for opportunities.,"Hello . I’m a recent Master of Science in Analytics graduate from Georgia Tech (GPA 3.91, top 5% of my class). I completed a practicum with Sandia Labs and I’m currently in discussions about further research with GT and SANDIA. I’m originally from Greece and I’ve built a strong portfolio of projects, ranging from classic data analysis and machine learning to a Resume AI chatbot.

I entered the job market feeling confident, but I’ve been surprised and disappointed by how tough things are here. The Greek market is crazy: I’ve seen openings that attract 100 applicants and still offer very low pay while expecting a lot. I’m applying to junior roles and have gone as far as seven interview rounds that tested pandas, PyTorch, Python, LeetCode-style problems, SQL, and a lot of behavioral and technical assessments.

Remote opportunities seem rare on EUROPE or US. I may be missing something, but I can’t find many remote openings.

This isn’t a complaint so much as an expression of frustration. It’s disheartening that a master’s from a top university, solid skills, hands-on projects, and a real practicum can still make landing a junior role so difficult. I’ve also noticed many job listings now list deep learning and PyTorch as mandatory, or rebrand positions as “AI engineer,” even when it doesn’t seem necessary.

On a positive note, I’ve had strong contacts reach out via LinkedIn  though most ask for relocation, which I can’t manage due to family reasons.

I’m staying proactive: building new projects, refining my interviewing skills, and growing my network. I’d welcome any advice, referrals, or remote-friendly opportunities. Thank you!

PS. If you comment your job experience state your country to get a picture of the worldwide problem.

PS2. Started as an attempt for networking and opportunities, came down to an interesting realistic discussion. Still sad to read, what's the future of this job? What will happen next? What recent grads and on university juniors should be doing?

I run www.sportsjobs(.)online, a job board in that niche. In the last month I added around 300 jobs.

For the ones that already saw my posts before, I've added more sources of jobs lately. I'm open to suggestions to prioritize the next batch.

It's a niche, there aren't thousands of jobs as in Software in general but my commitment is to **keep improving a simple metric, jobs per month.** We always need some metric in DS..

I run also a newsletter to receive emails with jobs and interesting content on sports analytics (next edition tomorrow!)  
[https://sportsjobs-online.beehiiv.com/subscribe](https://sportsjobs-online.beehiiv.com/subscribe)

Finally, I've created also a [reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/sports_jobs/) where I post recurrently the openings if that's easier to check for you.

I hope this helps someone!",datascience,fark13,115,0.94,20,1756149836.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mzzzu7/we_are_back_with_many_data_science_jobs_in_soccer/,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mzzzu7/we_are_back_with_many_data_science_jobs_in_soccer/,Career | US,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:34:48.532129+00:00
1n0ep0g,How do I make the most of this opportunity,"Hello everyone, I’m a senior studying data science at a large state school. Recently, through some networking, I got to interview with a small real estate and financial data aggregator company with around \~100 employees.

I met with the CEO for my interview. As far as I know, they haven’t had an engineering or science intern before, mainly marketing and business interns. The firm has been primarily a more traditional real estate company for the last 150 years. Many tasks are done through SQL queries and Excel. Much of the product team at the company has been there for over 20 years and is resistant to change.

The ceo wants to make the company more efficient and modern, and implement some statistical and ML models and automated workflows with their large amounts of data. He has given me some of the ideas that he and others at the company have considered. I will list those at the end. But I am starting to feel that I’m a bit in over my head here as he hinted towards using my work as a proof of concept to show the board that these new technologies and techniques r what the company needs to stay relevant and competitive. As someone who is just wrapping up their undergrad, some of it feels beyond my abilities if I’m mainly going to be implementing a lot of these things solo.

  
These are some of the possible projects I would work on:

1mzlzsp,"First time writing a technical article, would love constructive feedback","Hi everyone,

I recently wrote my first blog post where I share a method I’ve been using to get good results on a fine-grained classification benchmark. This is something I’ve worked on for a while and wanted to put my thoughts together in an article.

I’m sharing it here **not as a promo** but because I’m genuinely looking to improve my writing and make sure my explanations are clear and useful. If you have a few minutes to read and share your thoughts (on structure, clarity, tone, level of detail, or anything else), I’d really appreciate it.
