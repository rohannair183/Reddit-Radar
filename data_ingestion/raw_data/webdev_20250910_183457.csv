1ncq269,"We are the W3C WebDX Community Group, working to improve developer experience with projects like Baseline. Ask Us Anything!","Hi r/webdev! We are members of the W3C Web Developer Experience Community Group (WebDX CG) and we'll be hosting an AMA right here on Thursday, September 18th, starting at 9:00 AM ET. We're all about making your life as a web developer easier, and we're here to chat about our projects like Baseline, and answer all your burning questions.

**What is the WebDX CG?**

[Our mission](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/admin/blob/main/charter.md) is to improve your experience developing for the Web platform, through two main pillars:

1. Coordinating research to get a clear, data-driven picture of the major obstacles and gaps that developers face every day.
2. Building a shared understanding of the interoperable parts of the web platform to promote clear, consistent communication about which features developers can use confidently.

We are a group of browser vendors, developers, and other web stakeholders dedicated to identifying and smoothing out the sharp edges of web development.

**What do we actually work on?**

You may already be familiar with some of our work, including 

* [Baseline](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/): Baseline provides clear information about which web platform features are compatible across a core set of browsers. It gives developers confidence in the level of browser compatibility when reading articles or choosing libraries for their projects. By aligning with Baseline, developers can expect fewer surprises when testing their sites.
* Supporting Interoperability: Our work directly supports browser interoperability. By defining clear feature sets (like Baseline), we create a shared target for browser vendors and reduce the inconsistencies that cause developer frustration. Examples of projects built on this data include the [Web platform features explorer](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/) and [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev/). 
* Understanding developer needs: We facilitate and publish research like short surveys on MDN and the State of CSS, HTML, and JS surveys. We dig into the survey data and other developer signals to help the web platform ecosystem understand what you, the developers, need most.

**Who will be answering your questions?**

We have several members of the CG here to take your questions. Here's who's on the panel:

* François Daoust\* (u/Internal\_Self730), W3C Web Specialist
* Patrick Brosset\* (u/WebPlatformLover), Microsoft Edge PM
* Kadir Topal (u/aktopal), Google Chrome PM
* Philip Jägenstedt (u/foolip), Google Chrome Engineer
* Rachel Andrew (u/rachelandrew), Google Chrome DevRel
* Rick Viscomi (u/rviscomi), Google Chrome DevRel
* Jeremy Wagner (u/jlwagner), Google Chrome DevRel
* James Stuckey Weber (u/jamessw), OddBird Developer

*\* CG Chair*

**Ask Us Anything!**

We'll be here to answer your questions on Thursday, September 18th, starting at 9:00 AM ET.

We're ready to discuss:

* The methodology and future of Baseline
* How Baseline differs from other resources like MDN and Can I Use
* The biggest DX challenges you think the web faces
* How developer feedback influences browser interoperability
* How an individual developer can get involved and make their voice heard
* What our day-to-day work looks like in the CG

We're looking forward to a great discussion.

I'm not a hypocrite and cringe when I see other business owners doing this

However.. I feel that a business thats (often associated with scammers) like mine, had a face on the cover speaking and obv not ai generated..

It could potentially gain me the trust of those clients who are smart to question the ⚠️quality⚠️ of businesses related to mine.

1ndbijs,Refresh token - stolen and 'real user' does not attempt a refresh until after cookie expires.,"Hi,

I'm trying to wrap my head around a situation where we have the below flow, and feel like i'm missing something. What happens if a refresh token is stolen, and the real user does not attempt to use their original refresh token until after it is expired? This is in the situation where a user can log in on multiple devices / browsers, so multiple Refresh Token chains could exist.

`Real Actor := RA, Malicious Actor := MA, Refresh Token (1day) := RT, Access Token (15min) := AT.`

1. RA logs in, and receives AT1 and RT1 stored in secure, HTTP cookies. RT1 is written to database for revocation/reuse detection purposes.
2. MA steals RT1 and uses this to refresh the access token. MA receives AT2 and RT2. RT2 is written to database, and RT1 is marked as revoked.
3. MA continues to act maliciously,.. MA receives AT7 and RT7. RT7 is written to database, and RT2-RT6 are marked as revoked.
4. RA does not perform any activity until after their RT1 has expired.

I understand that if RA used their RT1 prior to it expiring, then we would detect that they are using a revoked RT and then proceed with revoking all RTs, nullifying the impact of the malicious actor. However if RA does not use their RT until after the cookie expires, then when they go to use it they'll be forced to sign in again, and receive a new RT and start a new RT chain, but the existing RT chain that the malicious actor has will remain valid...

What am I missing here?

**Edit:**

* Is the answer not having the cookie that stores the refresh token (a JWT) expire? If this is the case, do we then just not worry about the JWT having expired (ie jwt.decode not jwt.verify when getting the JTI to look up in the database) when checking if it is a re-use?
* A secondary question, if the real actor never interacts back with the server, or does so on a totally new device (and therefor new refresh token chain), is there anyway to stop the malicious actor from continuing to act, or is it only if the real actor hits a 'log-out of all devices' button?",webdev,peoth,7,0.82,7,1757503466.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ndbijs/refresh_token_stolen_and_real_user_does_not/,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ndbijs/refresh_token_stolen_and_real_user_does_not/,,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:31:43.889413+00:00

1ncgxw1,"Vanilla JS/HTML in 2025: What’s the Best Way to Build a Web App Without React, Vue, or Svelte?”","I’ve been asked to build a KYC system. We’ll start with a small MVP:

* Collect user info,
* Store it in a database,
* Include basic authentication.

I've been debating with the right stack - especially for the frontend.

I love the DX of frameworks like Next.js, React Router, Solid, Svelte, and Astro. But they all ship extra JavaScript that users don’t need. For a little-to-no-interactive small app, that feels like overkill.

(I love the snapiness of a mimialminimal JS-free site!) 

I’m debating:

* **Qwik**: It's a framework. But, minimal JS is shipped to the browser. I'm unsure if it’s easy for new teammates to pick up or it becomes too niche (Remember we're in a B2B setting and long term support matters)
* **HTMX**: I like it a lot, but then my head starts spinning with the details:
   * **Minification** – What tool should I use? Vite/Rollup expect a single entry file, but I’d need something that handles JS per path. Gulp could work, but that means writing my own build pipeline.
   * **Components** – Frameworks like React/Svelte make components simple and give me SSR. With Web Components (even with Lit), I run into issues like Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). There are SSR options for Web Components, but I haven’t tried them yet.
   * **Critical CSS** – I’d like to extract and inline important CSS for faster loads.



I once tried Go + HTMX, but I went back to Remix because:

* components in HTMX felt too verbose,
* I had to manage a full build system,
* orchestrating JS file loads was painful.





I’d love to “go back to the platform” (just HTML + JS), but all the old problems come back.

It's probably a pretty easy explanation, but does anyone know why pinning the ScrollTrigger created in `createScrollAnimation` interferes (breaks) the text animations?

I think it's probably because the whole element gets wrapped in a new pinned container, but I still can't get the logic of how exactly that impacts the animation straight in my head.

1ndb7io,Preventing user from accessing Resources,"Hi!
I'm developing a simple web app that offers immersive lessons that show users 3D models and allows them to interact with them. I'm planning on making this application run without any user signups (All users will be anonymous). 

What I'm worried about currently is that I'm calling the resources (3D models) from my hosted server. Therefore, any end user can simply go on to the developer settings > Network settings and simply download my custom built 3D models which I worked really hard on.

I've explored multiple options on encrpyting the assets but they all seem to use authentication tokens.

Is there any way to encrypt assets or any other options of making them undownloadable through the dev settings?

1ncugm6,Is it worth translating your website?,"I have a high traffic network tools website. Its in English. I only speak English. 

This morning I was thinking how I could pretty easily make a system that would let you pick a language and the website could be in that language. 

I could do it entirely with javascript and a cookie. Or I could do it with php and different subdomains so it would be more indexable. 

But my question is, is it worth doing? Is there really a benefit to it, or is English so global that it really won't matter much? 

To make it worthwhile, it would have to ultimately increase my traffic by some reasonable amount, and improve my search results. 

If so, which languages would be best to do? I could do spanish easy enough, I know people who speak spanish. And I know the spanish alphabet. Same with Italian although I don't think theres much demand for italian language websites. When it comes to chinese or indian languages though, it would be much harder to get that translated.

1ncr8lj,There needs to be a way to disable (and detect) forced back swipe transitions in mobile browsers.,"iOS had it forever, and now Chrome on Android [is following suit](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-back-forward-animations-3582562/): browser-level swipe transitions while performing a back gesture, where the previous page swipes out towards the right, slowly revealing the previous page below.

I understand the intent behind it, and I understand that it's better than no transition. But the thing is: we *just* got the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) last year, which makes it easy to achieve native app-like, highly customizable transitions including element handover between pages. Unfortunately, these browser-level transitions break site-controlled transitions by forcing themselves on top, disregarding fixed headers / bottom navs that are supposed to stay in place while navigating between pages. And worse, when you actually take enough care to leverage the Web Transition API, your custom transition plays after the browser's finishes, which looks incredibly glitchy. And yes, at least in the case of Chrome Android, this new behavior applies even when the page is installed as a PWA.

For reference, [here's an example of how the latest version of Chrome Android behaves with a back gesture on one of Google's own Web Transition API demo pages](https://imgur.com/a/yeqkSS6). The first back navigation shows the transition as the page intends. The second navigation has the browser's new transition on top, completely breaking the intended transition and resulting in glitchy behavior.

With these kinds of forced transitions now in place by default on both major mobile platforms (and also macOS browsers with trackpad gestures), there really needs to be a way for a page to opt-out of browser transitions if it opts into the Web Transition API, and / or *at the very least* a way for the page to detect if the browser forces its own transitions, so that any custom ones can be disabled.

Otherwise, there's realistically little sense in investing any time to build high-quality transitions using the View Transition API.",webdev,efstajas,10,0.92,2,1757443339.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ncr8lj/there_needs_to_be_a_way_to_disable_and_detect/,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ncr8lj/there_needs_to_be_a_way_to_disable_and_detect/,Discussion,True,False,False,False,False,,2025-09-10T22:32:14.012656+00:00
1ndi10r,How can I demonstrate to a potential client with 15+ years more experience than me that I'm not just another silicon valley brat?,"Hi all.

We recently got a request that I honestly didn't know how to answer, and it was a little embarrassing to say the least. 

A prospective client was interested in having us build a website for them to then self host. They needed a CMS, but gave no further preferences beyond not loving reliance on WordPress plugins for UI (elementor, divi, etc). 

This client is old school. They've been in the game for longer than I've been an adult, and they know what they're doing. IT/cybersecurity firm. 

So when I turned around and suggested Webflow as a potentially faster, more convenient solution, I think I spooked them. I had inadvertently implied that we'd export the code from Webflow and then host that, which understandably, they saw as a very large problem. 

I should have just honed in on their existing stack and then offered to work within that. Now, I fear their website manager (whom I have not yet spoken to), is under the impression I'm trying to push some WYSIWYG they don't need because that's all I know. 

At this point all I can do is clarify that's not my intention and hope we can work it out. 

For next time, though, how should I approach it differently? 

If you were a site manager who's been doing it since the days of table-based layouts, but you just didn't have time to fuss with redoing the site, how would you want an outside consultant to approach offering to help?

1nbz30a,"I tried my hand at creating a ""Twitter for gaming"" and I've grown to regret it","I own and run a site called [gametips.gg](https://gametips.gg/timeline) and part of my daily process usually involves me going ""this might be neat!!"" and then diving into it without thinking it through too much.

I don't know why but I've always admired that Moxfield (MTG website) have [announced they'd so something similar](https://untapleagues.com/what-moxfield-needs-to-do-to-make-their-magic-the-gathering-social-media-website-a-success/) for MTG fans back in 2022 (not out yet) by building a social media platform in-site and it's basically been living rent free in my head since then. I've always wanted to try my hand at something similar so I decided I'd try it on my [gametips.gg](https://gametips.gg/timeline) website.

What I thought would be relatively easy turned into hours upon hours of work and bugfixes to the point where I have a sort of viable MVP without any fancy bells or whistles like timeline algorithms and I've just ended up feeling kinda bad about it. 

I managed to implement the following;

* Basic timeline view
* A semi-optimized mobile view 
* Video/Image support with optimizations (image is converted and video is transcoded and replaced automatically post uploaded)
* Opengraph support
* Hashtag support 
* @ mention support 
* Reply / Repost / Like
* Websocket support for ""x amount of posts have been posted, click to load"" on the top of the timeline
* Misc functionality like delete tweet, etc etc

It still needs a ton of fixes and tweaks but I'm now hesitant to progress with it. 

Even with all that. It doesn't feel like BlueSky or Twitter and I'm not sure why. It almost feels like a Forum but presented differently. I don't know, maybe that's what Twitter and Bluesky essentially are but I can't shake the feeling that I haven't captured what makes Twitter, Twitter and what makes Bluesky, Bluesky. It's almost like I am missing a magic ingredient and I don't know what it is. Maybe this is just self-developer guilt where I feel like the thing I made isn't good enough versus x or y.

And now that I've spent countless hours and time down this rabbit hole I'm starting to wonder was this just wasted dev time when my focus should have been elsewhere. How do you all manage these feelings when you jump into a feature, go at it headfirst without giving it too much thought and before you know it, it's already too far ahead for you to throw away the work you've put in. I've had to put a halt to my feature-list to try put a level head on and gauge if they are a good idea before jumping into them else it becomes feature after feature instead of refinements where needed. 

I think I'm just looking for advice for those who have been down this route of developing something that you end up feeling bad about and maybe I can start feeling a bit better about it once I know I'm not alone lol

How do you battle the horrible feeling of wasting your own time?

1nbqrf7,"Public announcement: AI is cool and all, but please use it wisely. Just because ""it works"" doesn't mean it's good enough.","I'm working with a friend who is a coder-gone-vibe-coder and he creates parts of the project with Cursor.

There are multiple issues with the code blocks (even though the project works for the end user) but under the hood, so much stuff wrong and it's a mess.

Look at this code.

We have 2 pieces of data coming from the database: `first_name` and `last_name`. Now compare the AI solution at creating the user's initials versus my solution:

AI / Cursor
```
const userName = profile.first_name + ' ' + profile.last_name

const initials = userName
  .split(' ')
  .filter(Boolean)
  .map(n => n[0])
  .join('')
  .slice(0, 2)
```

My code
```
const initials = profile?.first_name?.[0].toUpperCase() + profile?.last_name?.[0].toUpperCase()
```

My point isn't that I'm better than a computer. My point is that do not just mindlessly accept whatever ChatGPT and Cursor and Lovable output just because ""well, it works so it's good"".
